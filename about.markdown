I am currently a student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science and planning on graduating in Spring of 2022. I grew up in Everett, Washington and am a proud graduate of Cascade High School.

At UW, I like to stay involved. I am presently the Secretary of UW's Association for Computing Machinery, where I help host department-wide academic, professional, and social events intended to keep students engaged with the Allen School and its community. I was a committee member of ASUW's Elections Administration Committee, where I worked on the 2020 ASUW elections, which were unprecedented due to their virtual nature.

I am excited to serve as a TA for CSE 142, or Computer Programming I, this upcoming quarter.

My greatest two interests are politics and computer science, so I like to find ways to explore their intersection. As of now, this site is just for my assorted little projects that spark my interest. Feel free to check out some of the stuff I have worked on.
