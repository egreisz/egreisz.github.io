Selected Projects
======
**Distributed Key-Value Store, Class Project, April - June 2021**
 * Designed and built a distributed, sharded, fault-tolerant key-value store using
MultiPaxos consensus protocols.

**Vaccine Stock Tracker, Capstone Project, April - June 2021**
 * Designed an end-to-end system used to manage vaccine stock at various facilities
 * Includes a mobile application made with ODK-X, a Java Spring web server, and a
Javascript frontend dashboard to visualize data with libraries like D3.
 * Allows a government or organization to track vaccine inventory across geographic regions and with distributed data entry.

**XK Operating System, Class Project, Jan - March 2021**
 * Implemented a writable file system, multiprocessing (fork-exec), a variable heap and
stack, and crash safety on top of a very basic OS.
 * Explored and added optimizations, like copy-on-write.

**Search Engine, Class Project, Oct - Dec 2020**
* Built a multi-threaded system that would catalogue the presence and frequencies of words in a document, write the abstraction to a index file that would store this for many documents, and allow the user to search for words across these documents.
* Additionally, built the system to manage network connections to the search engine and return search results or files as HTTP responses.
* Completely done in C and C++, primarily using POSIX functionality. Done as a part of CSE 333, Systems Programming.

**Sentiment Analysis of 2020 Campaigns, Personal Project, [Link](/2020/09/14/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Trump-and-Biden-Events.html), Sep 2020**
* Used nltk and other data science python libraries to analyze sentiment of the two major presidential campaigns based on a Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.
* Classified some of the data manually to create training and test data.
* Explored topics such as web scraping and core pieces of natural language programming such as tokenization and normalization.

**SmartScheduler, Personal Project with Friend, June - August 2020**
* Built an Android app designed to help users schedule their tasks for teh day based on what they needed to get done and their available time.
* Algorithm determines which tasks are most important and schedules the day to optimize productivity.
* Built using Xamarin.Forms and Xamarin.Android with C# and XAML.
* Persistently stores user data using SQLite to maintain information between sessions.

**UW Campus Map, Class Project, Feb - March 2020**
* Developed React front-end allowing users to select a start and a destination to display a path for. Enhanced to create an intuitive user design.
* Built back-end that parsed a dataset of all paths on campus, constructed a resultant graph, and could find the shortest path between any two buildings using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Done in Java on a Spark Server.
* Completed as a part of CSE 331, Software Design and Implementation.
