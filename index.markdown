I am currently a student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science and planning on graduating in Spring of 2022. 

In particular, I am excited to be an incoming SWE Intern at Expedia for Summer 2021!

As of now, this site is just for my assorted little projects that spark my interest. Feel free to check out some of the stuff I have worked on.

Education
======
**B.S. Computer Science, University of Washington, 2019 - Present**
 * Expected Graduation: Spring 2022
 * Overall GPA: 3.93
 * Computer Science GPA: 3.93
 * Awarded with the Annual Dean's List Award and placed on the Dean's List each equarter.

Work Experience
======
 **Teaching Assistant, Paul G. Allen School, University of Washington, Sep 2020 - Present**

 * Weekly grading of assignments, teaching section once a week to review and practice some of the material gone over in lecture that week and develop some additional material that was not reached, and holding office hours every week for students to get some additional support in their assignments.
 * Working with the rest of the teaching team to develop the direction of the course to be both comprehensive and well-adjusted to a virtual setting.

Student Involvement
======
**Secretary, Association for Computing Machinery @ UW, June 2020 - Present**
* Started as an Associate Officer from October 2019, I joined the officer team as Secretary when officer transitions happened in June.
* Helped to plan, organize, and run various academic, social, and professional events to help build community within the CS department at UW, such as Trivia Nights, Escape Rooms, and Internship Panels.
* Worked with the rest of the ACM team to help facilitate the transition to virtual quarters and a full schedule of virtual events.

**Committee Member, ASUW Elections Administration Committee, January - May 2020**
* Served as a member of the committee that organized and planned the annual election to elect new campus-wide ASUW officers.
* Worked with the Programming Subcommittee to plan various forums to allow students to get to know candidates.
* As a team, we transitioned to an entirely virtual election partway through our planning, requiring a renewed format and plans.

Selected Projects
======
**Search Engine, Class Project, Oct - Dec 2020**
* Built a multi-threaded system that would catalogue the presence and frequencies of words in a document, write the abstraction to a index file that would store this for many documents, and allow the user to search for words across these documents.
* Additionally, built the system to manage network connections to the search engine and return search results or files as HTTP responses.
* Completely done in C and C++, primarily using POSIX functionality. Done as a part of CSE 333, Systems Programming.

**Sentiment Analysis of 2020 Campaigns, Personal Project, [Link](/2020/09/14/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Trump-and-Biden-Events.html), Sep 2020**
* Used nltk and other data science python libraries to analyze sentiment of the two major presidential campaigns based on a Na√Øve Bayes algorithm.
* Classified some of the data manually to create training and test data.
* Explored topics such as web scraping and core pieces of natural language programming such as tokenization and normalization.

**SmartScheduler, Personal Project with Friend, June - August 2020**
* Built an Android app designed to help users schedule their tasks for teh day based on what they needed to get done and their available time.
* Algorithm determines which tasks are most important and schedules the day to optimize productivity.
* Built using Xamarin.Forms and Xamarin.Android with C# and XAML.
* Persistently stores user data using SQLite to maintain information between sessions.

**UW Campus Map, Class Project, February - March 2020**
* Developed React front-end allowing users to select a start and a destination to display a path for. Enhanced to create an intuitive user design.
* Built back-end that parsed a dataset of all paths on campus, constructed a resultant graph, and could find the shortest path between any two buildings using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Done in Java on a Spark Server.
* Completed as a part of CSE 331, Software Design and Implementation.
