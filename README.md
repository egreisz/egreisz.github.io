I am currently a student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science and planning on graduating with my Bachelor's in Winter 2022 and my Master's in Spring 2023. 

My greatest two interests are politics and computer science, so I like to find ways to explore their intersection. I also consider myself quite the expert on film trivia, but I don't imagine that will sneak its way into this website.

As of now, this site is just for my assorted little projects that spark my interest. Feel free to check out some of the stuff I have worked on.
