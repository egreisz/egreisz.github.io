# **Rudimentary Sentiment Analysis of Campaign Speeches By President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden**


By Elijah Greisz

A major aspect of political campaigning--perhaps the most fundamental aspect--is messaging. Campaigns are often lauded or decried for their messaging, whether it is inspirational or depressing.

No doubt studied in much more detail in political science research, this research is often qualitative in nature, as is sensible for a topic of this sort. However, in the following notebook, I will begin to explore a quantitative approach--sentiment analysis--to this qualitative problem. This does pose many restrictions, particularly to someone of my limited experience. First among them, we are going to simply classify speeches and speech language as positive, neutral, or negative. While there is much more nuance to the language and effect of a speech, these are the most fundamental categories that we can provide. More discussion over what classifies as which category will be discussed later.

Next, if you missed the title, you might wonder on what data this analysis will be performed. Simply by virtue of the present time, we are closest to the November 2020 presidential election, putting former Vice President Joe Biden against incumbent President Donald Trump. This makes this research topical and relevant, but there are other factors that make the data from this upcoming election useful and insightful:
*   First among them, this election is unprecedented in the way that it is conducted. Due to the emergence of Covid-19 and the lingering pandemic, the process of campaigning has been reinvented for this election. With a much greater proportion of virtual events, there is more readily available access to the candidates and their speeches. This allows the presence of transcripts for almost all of their campaign events.
*   Second is the growing use of technology, and its impact on campaigning. Not only are campaign events and transcripts more available than ever before, so are comments from supporters of each campaign. Rather than having to poll in order to get the opinions of the American public, we can simply access the various social media sites in which political discussion happens (although there is certainly some limitations to this). This makes this research easily extendable to examine how supporters of a campaign respond to the sentiment of the candidate's messaging. Is their sentiment similar? How might this vary by platform?
*   Third is the nature of politics in 2020. In the past few decades, politics have become increasingly polarized to an unprecedented level. Just 36 years ago, 49 states went to Reagan. It is impossible to have a landslide election like that with modern politics. While this is not a comment on the origin or issues with this polarization, it is something to be recognized. It is enough that both sides of this election agree with the fact that the result will have instrumental and unprecedented ramifications. Thus, we might expect a more negative sentiment from both candidates, but that is yet to be seen.

With that, we can begin our analysis.

NOTE: Proper style conventions usually dictate that both candidates be addressed with their proper titles, President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. In no disrespect to their titles, I will omit these and simply address them as Biden and Trump to save time and minimize repetition.

# Step 1: Data Collection and Arrangement

<h3>Finding a Data Source</h3>

The most important part of any research is getting adequate data. For this process, we want to look at speeches done by the two major candidates.

There was initally some consideration to use audio transcription (such as the SpeechRecognition model in Python) to create written transcripts from audio of the events. Another idea was to export captions from youtube (which are usually hand-written for campaigns). The issue with these became separating the text into sentences and ensuring that the candidate's speaking was distinguishable from the rest.

This led to https://www.rev.com/. This website is a hirable transcription service that is paid to transcribe audio into written transcripts. Luckily, they maintain a transcript library (at https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts) that holds transcripts to major speeches, including all of those of the 2020 general election campaign. As a result, we can use the transcripts from this website as our documents in our sentiment analysis. Simply going through and collecting all of Biden's speeches into one file and Trump's into another. I chose an adequate date range: August 1st to September 10th to get a sizeable amount of speeches during a particularly important period of the campaign, containing Biden's VP nominee announcement as well as both conventions. This is the period in which the campaigns refine and settle on a message that will stick until November 3rd.


The following are the transcripts for Biden's assembled campaign events. There are 12 of them stored in a CSV file showing the link to the webpage, the name of the speech, and the date in which they occurred.

```

Now that we have found the data that we are going to use, we need to actually extract the data from these webpages in order to use it programmatically. To do this, we are going to take advantage of web-scraping in Python. But first, we need to read our two CSV files, which can simply be done with the python library pandas.


```
import pandas as pd

biden_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/biden_transcript_links.csv', index_col=0)
trump_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/trump_transcript_links.csv', index_col=0)
```

This has now created two data frames, one for each candidate, storing the data that was stored in CSV file. We now need to actually extract the transcripts from the rev.com website. To do this, we are going to start with using urllib.request to get the html file for each event we are examining. Then, we are using the BeautifulSoup module to take this html file and break it into html elements. After that, we can extract all the paragraph tags and their corresponding texts. We traverse this list of tags and grab only the texts that are preceded by a "Biden:" or "Trump:"(as this indicates that the candidate is speaking). These are each added to a list of documents. In the end, for each speech, we are storing the title of the event, the date it was given, as well as a list of documents for that speech. The code follows:


```
import urllib.request
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from datetime import datetime

biden = []
trump = []
doc_index = 0
documents = {}

biden_docs = 0
trump_docs = 0

for link, speech in biden_df.iterrows():
  # Get the html file from the provided link
  content = urllib.request.urlopen(link)

  read_content = content.read()

  # Parse html and find all the paragraph tags
  soup = BeautifulSoup(read_content, 'html.parser')
  pAll = soup.find_all('p')

  min_index = doc_index

  # Collect content of all text in which Biden is speaking
  for p in pAll:
    if('Biden:' in p.text):
      documents[doc_index] = {'text': p.text[p.text.find('Biden:') + 15:], 'speech' : speech['name'], 'candidate': 'biden'}
      doc_index += 1
      biden_docs += 1

  # Add data to our biden dataset
  biden.append({'title': speech['name'], 'date':datetime.strptime(speech['date'], '%m/%d/%Y'), 'min_index':min_index, 'max_index':doc_index-1})

for link, speech in trump_df.iterrows():
  # Get the html file from the provided link
  content = urllib.request.urlopen(link)

  read_content = content.read()

  # Parse html and find all the paragraph tags
  soup = BeautifulSoup(read_content, 'html.parser')
  pAll = soup.find_all('p')

  min_index = doc_index

  # Collect content of all text in which Biden is speaking
  for p in pAll:
    if('Trump:' in p.text):
      documents[doc_index] = {'text': p.text[p.text.find('Trump:') + 15:], 'speech' : speech['name'], 'candidate': 'trump'}
      doc_index += 1
      trump_docs += 1
  # Add data to our biden dataset
  trump.append({'title': speech['name'], 'date':datetime.strptime(speech['date'], '%m/%d/%Y'), 'min_index':min_index, 'max_index':doc_index-1})
```


```
print(f"Total documents: {doc_index}")
print(f'Biden documents: {biden_docs}')
print(f'Trump documents: {trump_docs}')
print(documents[0])
```

    Total documents: 1248
    Biden documents: 362
    Trump documents: 886
    {'text': 'Good afternoon folks. Sorry I’m a little late. I was a mesmerized. I was walking out of the office, that listening to an interview of former General Barry McCaffrey and Bill Cohen, former Secretary of Defense. Before I begin, I want to speak a little bit to what they talked about and the revelations about President Trump’s disregard for our military and our veterans. Quite frankly, if what is written in the Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting. At affirms what most of us believe to be true, that Donald Trump is not fit to do the job of President, to be the Commander in Chief. The President reportedly said, and I emphasize reportedly, said that those who sign up to serve, instead of doing something more lucrative are suckers. Let me be real clear. When my son was an Assistant US Attorney and he volunteered to go to Kosovo, when the war is going on as a civilian, he wasn’t a sucker.', 'speech': 'Joe Biden Press Conference Transcript September 4', 'candidate': 'biden'}
    

From this, we can see that 362 out of the 1248 docs were spoken by Biden, or 29%. This is 886 docs for Trump, or 71%. These numbers will become important later when looking at proportionality.

Additionally, we can examine what one document looks like. For this research, I am simply just storing the text of the document, the title of the event, and the candidate that gave it (for now).

Now, I have been using the term **"document"** to describe what we are storing for the candidates. Let me specify what this term means.

In sentiment analysis, documents are the sequences of text that we are analyzing the sentiment of. The length of these documents depends on the application of the analysis: they might be sentences, paragraphs, or entire essays. The reason we use documents is because smaller pieces, like words, are often too atomic and contain too little meaning alone. Context, and most of the meaning, requires a longer sequence of words.

In this case, we will be using the given text-blocks as written in the rev.com transcripts. These generally dictate one of two things: either an answer to a question, or a paragraph about a certain topic. When the speechgiver switches topics, for example, it is made a new text-block. As such, this is a natural document to use: for each topic the candidate is discussing, are they using a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment?

At this point, we have organized our data and can begin to move on to actually using it.

# Step 2: Tokenization

We now have the pieces of text that we want to analyze, but it is not enough to just shove these at a computer and ask what their tone is. After all, each is just a string of words. As such, we can **"tokenize"** these strings into a list of words. We will use nltk to do so.

First we must download punkt to use the tokenize methods.


```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

Then, we just want to tokenize each document of each speech and store them in our data structure. 


```
for doc_id in documents:
  documents[doc_id]['document_tokens'] = nltk.word_tokenize(documents[doc_id]['text'])
```

As an example, we can look at the tokenized version of a single document in a speech.


```
print(documents[0]['document_tokens'])
```

    ['Good', 'afternoon', 'folks', '.', 'Sorry', 'I', '’', 'm', 'a', 'little', 'late', '.', 'I', 'was', 'a', 'mesmerized', '.', 'I', 'was', 'walking', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'office', ',', 'that', 'listening', 'to', 'an', 'interview', 'of', 'former', 'General', 'Barry', 'McCaffrey', 'and', 'Bill', 'Cohen', ',', 'former', 'Secretary', 'of', 'Defense', '.', 'Before', 'I', 'begin', ',', 'I', 'want', 'to', 'speak', 'a', 'little', 'bit', 'to', 'what', 'they', 'talked', 'about', 'and', 'the', 'revelations', 'about', 'President', 'Trump', '’', 's', 'disregard', 'for', 'our', 'military', 'and', 'our', 'veterans', '.', 'Quite', 'frankly', ',', 'if', 'what', 'is', 'written', 'in', 'the', 'Atlantic', 'is', 'true', ',', 'it', '’', 's', 'disgusting', '.', 'At', 'affirms', 'what', 'most', 'of', 'us', 'believe', 'to', 'be', 'true', ',', 'that', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'is', 'not', 'fit', 'to', 'do', 'the', 'job', 'of', 'President', ',', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'Commander', 'in', 'Chief', '.', 'The', 'President', 'reportedly', 'said', ',', 'and', 'I', 'emphasize', 'reportedly', ',', 'said', 'that', 'those', 'who', 'sign', 'up', 'to', 'serve', ',', 'instead', 'of', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'lucrative', 'are', 'suckers', '.', 'Let', 'me', 'be', 'real', 'clear', '.', 'When', 'my', 'son', 'was', 'an', 'Assistant', 'US', 'Attorney', 'and', 'he', 'volunteered', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'Kosovo', ',', 'when', 'the', 'war', 'is', 'going', 'on', 'as', 'a', 'civilian', ',', 'he', 'wasn', '’', 't', 'a', 'sucker', '.']
    

As seen here, each word within this document is now separated into its own string. Punctuation is presently included as its own word. This does break apart contractions, but you will see later why this is not a hugh issue. This makes analyzing these documents programmatically much easier. However, this runs into a couple of issues.

# Step 3: Normalization

The first issue comes from the nuance of language. The same word, "listen," for example, can have countless different forms: "listen," "listening," "listened," and "listens." Or even worse, the infinitive "to be" can become "am," "is," "was," or "are," among others. Both tense and subject of a clause will change the written form of a word but not the meaning. In this process, we don't want to consider these all 'different' words. They all mean the same thing and all have the same sentiment, so we want to go through the process of normalization.

**Normalization**, in Natural Language Processing, is the process of transforming the many versions of the word into a single version.

There are multiple ways to do this. For one, we can use the process of **stemming**. This traditionally removes the end of words to reduce them to a normalized form ("listening" becomes "listen"). However, this is prone to error with some words. Instead, we are going to use the significantly slower but more accurate approach of **lemmatization**. This process is significantly more complex and relies on looking at the structure and context of a word. Of course, we will not be writing this algorithm ourself. Rather, we will take advantage of the tools nltk provides.

To begin with, we will need to download some tools.


```
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

The first thing, the 'wordnet,' is a databse for the English language. The second, the tagger, tags words to determine their context in a language (such as whether they are a noun or a verb, singular or plural, past or present). We can then use the tags to lemmatize the word depending on whether it is a noun, verb, or adjective according to what is contained within the imported wordnet.

Simultaneously, we also want to remove any punctuation from the words, as they are now tokenized, and it is no longer useful. We can use the re module to use regex methods to remove punctuation from strings.

Additionally, there are going to be many words which do not effect the meaning of the document. These are commonly called "stop words," described as words left ignored in search engines. Some examples may be "a," "an," "the," and all the other common English language words. Luckily, nltk has a built in corpus of stopwords, which we must download.


```
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

We can now use these to lemmatize the tokens that we got from Step 2.


```
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import re

lem = WordNetLemmatizer()
all_words_in_data = [] 

for doc_id in documents:
  lem_doc = []
  for word,tag in pos_tag(documents[doc_id]['document_tokens']):
    # remove punctuation
    word = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','',word)
    # Get appropriate tag for lemmatizer
    if tag[:2] == 'NN':
      lem_tag = 'n' 
    elif tag[:2] == 'VB':
      lem_tag = 'v'
    else:
      lem_tag = 'a'
    word = lem.lemmatize(word, lem_tag).lower()
    # add word to the list of tokens
    if len(word) > 0 and word not in stopwords.words('english'):
      lem_doc.append(word)
      all_words_in_data.append(word)
    documents[doc_id]['lem_form'] = lem_doc

```

We can examine an example to look at what exactly this has done:


```
pre_list = documents[0]['document_tokens']
post_list = documents[0]['lem_form']
print(f'Pre-lemmatization: {pre_list}')
print(f'Post-lemmatization: {post_list}')
```

    Pre-lemmatization: ['Good', 'afternoon', 'folks', '.', 'Sorry', 'I', '’', 'm', 'a', 'little', 'late', '.', 'I', 'was', 'a', 'mesmerized', '.', 'I', 'was', 'walking', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'office', ',', 'that', 'listening', 'to', 'an', 'interview', 'of', 'former', 'General', 'Barry', 'McCaffrey', 'and', 'Bill', 'Cohen', ',', 'former', 'Secretary', 'of', 'Defense', '.', 'Before', 'I', 'begin', ',', 'I', 'want', 'to', 'speak', 'a', 'little', 'bit', 'to', 'what', 'they', 'talked', 'about', 'and', 'the', 'revelations', 'about', 'President', 'Trump', '’', 's', 'disregard', 'for', 'our', 'military', 'and', 'our', 'veterans', '.', 'Quite', 'frankly', ',', 'if', 'what', 'is', 'written', 'in', 'the', 'Atlantic', 'is', 'true', ',', 'it', '’', 's', 'disgusting', '.', 'At', 'affirms', 'what', 'most', 'of', 'us', 'believe', 'to', 'be', 'true', ',', 'that', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'is', 'not', 'fit', 'to', 'do', 'the', 'job', 'of', 'President', ',', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'Commander', 'in', 'Chief', '.', 'The', 'President', 'reportedly', 'said', ',', 'and', 'I', 'emphasize', 'reportedly', ',', 'said', 'that', 'those', 'who', 'sign', 'up', 'to', 'serve', ',', 'instead', 'of', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'lucrative', 'are', 'suckers', '.', 'Let', 'me', 'be', 'real', 'clear', '.', 'When', 'my', 'son', 'was', 'an', 'Assistant', 'US', 'Attorney', 'and', 'he', 'volunteered', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'Kosovo', ',', 'when', 'the', 'war', 'is', 'going', 'on', 'as', 'a', 'civilian', ',', 'he', 'wasn', '’', 't', 'a', 'sucker', '.']
    Post-lemmatization: ['good', 'afternoon', 'folk', 'sorry', 'little', 'late', 'mesmerized', 'walk', 'office', 'listen', 'interview', 'former', 'general', 'barry', 'mccaffrey', 'bill', 'cohen', 'former', 'secretary', 'defense', 'begin', 'want', 'speak', 'little', 'bit', 'talk', 'revelation', 'president', 'trump', 'disregard', 'military', 'veteran', 'quite', 'frankly', 'write', 'atlantic', 'true', 'disgusting', 'affirms', 'us', 'believe', 'true', 'donald', 'trump', 'fit', 'job', 'president', 'commander', 'chief', 'president', 'reportedly', 'say', 'emphasize', 'reportedly', 'say', 'sign', 'serve', 'instead', 'something', 'lucrative', 'sucker', 'let', 'real', 'clear', 'son', 'assistant', 'us', 'attorney', 'volunteer', 'go', 'kosovo', 'war', 'go', 'civilian', 'sucker']
    

As you can see, there are some changes: 
*   Words were lemmatized: "was" became "be," "walking" became "walk," and "listening" became "listen." 
*   Punctuation was removed from the list
*   Stop words were removed from the list.

However, there are some limitations to this process. As we can see, "mesmerized" stayed as "mesmerized." This is likely because it was not in the wordnet that our lemmatization was checking. Yet, the quantity of these words are small enough--proportionally--that this should not make a significant impact on our results.


# Step 4: Building Training Data

While our data may seem ready to use, our model would not know what to do with it. How is it supposed to tell what is negative or positive when it has nothing to compare it to? The answer is simple: it can't.

As such, we need to give our model some sample data to let it know which documents have a positive sentiment and which have negative sentiment. Unfortunately, we are not using someone else's dataset that has pre-determined what classifies as what. Instead, we have to do it ourselves.

Obviously, this introduces significant bias into the model. My own determinations of positive and negative will dictate what the model will believe is positive and negative. Because of this, I will describe my exact method for classifying them:


*   **Positive**: statements propping up the candidate or the work they have done, such as "I have built the greatest economy" count. Completely neutral statements count, such as "How are you all doing today?" 
*   **Negative**: fear-mongering counts, such as hypothesizing the horrors that might happen in the 'opponent's America.' Denouncing the opponent's record counts. Verbally attacking the 'other side,' whether it is Democrats or Republicans, also counts.

With that, I will use the following method to classify them: pull 350 random documents from the the list, read each, and then determine whether positive or negative and classify accordingly. This takes a while, but it only needs to be done once.

Here is the code:


```
import random

biden_count = 0
trump_count = 0

docs_sampled = {}

# Read in any previous training_data that has been made
training_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/training_data.csv')
for doc in training_data.iterrows():
  doc_id = doc[1]['doc_id']
  docs_sampled[doc_id] = doc[1]['tag']
  if documents[doc_id]['candidate'] == 'biden':
    biden_count += 1
  else:
    trump_count += 1

random_doc = random.randint(0,len(documents) - 1)

# If more data needs to be hand-filtered, select positive or negative for each
while len(docs_sampled) < 500:
  while random_doc in docs_sampled:
    random_doc = random.randint(0,len(documents))
  print(documents[random_doc]['text'])
  pos_or_neg = input('Enter p for pos or n for negative')
  if pos_or_neg == 'p':
    docs_sampled[random_doc] = 'Positive'
  else:
    docs_sampled[random_doc] = 'Negative'
  if documents[random_doc]['candidate'] == 'biden':
    biden_count += 1
  else:
    trump_count += 1
  print(documents[random_doc]['lem_form'])
```

We can then store this in a data frame and write to a .csv file, so we will not need to repeat this process again.


```
df = pd.DataFrame()

for doc_id in docs_sampled:
  df = df.append({'doc_id':doc_id, 'tag' : docs_sampled[doc_id], 'text': documents[doc_id]['text'], 'tokens':{token : True for token in documents[doc_id]['lem_form']}}, ignore_index=True)

df.to_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/training_data.csv', index=False)
```

Now, we can examine our data to get some basic characteristics.


```
print(f"Number of docs in training_data: {len(docs_sampled)}")
print(f"Number of biden docs in training_data: {biden_count}")
print(f"Number of trump docs in training_data: {trump_count}")
print("A single doc:\n" + str(df.loc[0]))
```

    Number of docs in training_data: 500
    Number of biden docs in training_data: 143
    Number of trump docs in training_data: 357
    A single doc:
    doc_id                                                  905
    tag                                                Positive
    text      You know success brings people together, maybe...
    tokens    {'know': True, 'success': True, 'brings': True...
    Name: 0, dtype: object
    

As seen above, we have 500 total docs in our training data. 143 of those, or about 29%, were spoken by Biden. The other 357, or 71% of them, were spoken by Trump. This is very similar to the actual distribution, in which 29% of the docs are by Biden and 71% by Trump. Thus, this should hopefully provide a decent sample for sentiment analysis. Additionally, we can look at what a single document looks like in our dataframe: it stores an id, a classification tag, the full-text, and a list of tokens.

But before we continue, it is important to be transparent about my own process for doing this sample classification. As I already described, I tried to stick to a clear definition of **positive** and **negative**. Here is the entirety of the data for your own verification or challenge of my results:


```
# pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
# pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
for doc in df.iterrows():
  doc_id = doc[1]['doc_id']
  print("ID: " + str(doc[1]['doc_id']) + " " + doc[1]['tag'] + ": " + str(doc[1]['text']))
#print(df[['tag','text']])

```

    ID: 905.0 Positive: You know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we’re divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn’t talk about it as much, they didn’t say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what’s happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401(k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We’re very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we’ll call it the final phase of the pandemic.
    ID: 790.0 Positive: Under my administration, America’s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We’ve already built 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didn’t know that. They don’t know that. They’re paying for the wall.
    ID: 1206.0 Negative: And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good.
    ID: 521.0 Negative: That was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that. Your family lost the farm, lost their small business because they had to go and pay this ridiculous estate tax or death tax as they call it. And now you don’t have to worry about it. If you love your children, you leave it to them. If you don’t love your children, then it doesn’t matter what I did. Don’t leave it to them, give it to charity, give it to someone else. If they’re not good to you, if you don’t love… But does anybody here not love their children? Please raise your hand. You. Nobody. Good. I love that. Look at that one. You’re going to love that one, I guarantee. I guarantee you’re going to love that one. That’s a keeper. That’s a keeper, right? That’s great. You’ll love that one. Someday in a long time from now that beautiful child will not have to worry about estate taxes unless the Democrats do something in between, but we [inaudible 00:42:53].
    ID: 9.0 Negative: If you can hire a private tutor or have a live-in childcare, you can balance being a parent and remote schooling. If you can’t, you have to do your job and be a teacher all at once. Jill and I have held briefings on reopening school safety two days ago, asking the question as we hear so many parents call and ask us, educators as well who feel like they’re in an impossible situation. What are they supposed to do with our children when the president has made it so hard for schools to reopen safely? What’s the alternative when it’s devastating to keep them isolated from their friends and their support systems? I also said earlier this week, to the shock of many, we have lost more cops this year to COVID than on patrol. Just a reminder how an already dangerous job, law enforcement, has gotten more dangerous because of Trump’s mismanagement.
    ID: 693.0 Positive: I looked at numbers where one company is giving hundreds of millions of dollars.
    ID: 795.0 Negative: He wants mass amnesty. He wants illegal aliens to be taken care of, healthcare and every other way. And he wants to raise your taxes, [inaudible 00:09:52]. Look, your taxes are going to go through the roof. He’s going to destroy your health care. He’s going to have socialized medicine. Remember what Obama said 28 times? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Turned out to be a lie. Now you’re going to lose your doctor again. And we’re going to lose 185 million people who have private health insurance. Who has private health insurance here? And you love it, right? You love it. It’s luxury. It’s good. It’s beautiful. And you have the greatest, you’re going to lose it. Hate to tell you. Under his plan, you’re going to lose your private healthcare. So here’s a guy, I go into Texas two weeks ago. We had, by the way, on the highway and the roadways, thousands and thousands of people like lined up on the runway in New Hampshire, by the way. What happened to those people? But we had thousands and thousands of people. So I’m in Texas. I’m also, last week in Florida, we got total endorsement from all of the sheriffs. All over Florida. Ohio, many places. But think of Texas. He’s against oil and gas. He’s against guns. And he’s against religion. So you’re in Texas, you’re in Texas, where I’m winning by a lot. They say Texas is very close. I don’t think so. They said that last time too. Remember they said it last time? For them to call it early, you have to be really. So I heard, for a year, Texas is going to be very close. It’s going to be, everybody believed that except for the people that lived in Texas. So at 8:00, the polls close. And they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” Simultaneously with the closing.
    ID: 369.0 Positive: First time in a long time, but now we’re up in the polls. We just saw polls. We’re up in Michigan. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe we’re better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. I’m going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you’ve done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said, “Wait.”
    ID: 695.0 Negative: Oh, it’s terrible, what’s going on. But Black Lives Matter came into existence, walking down the street, screaming, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” And that was about police officers that was representing police. They were pigs, pigs in a blanket, like the sausages or hot dogs, fry them like bacon.
    ID: 1095.0 Positive: One of the great rip offs. It was done in my opinion, to hurt our country because we have so much energy. We’re now energy independent was I got out of this horrible Paris Climate Accord, which was a rip off on our country. It would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity. And they don’t even enter the agreement until 2030. So, it would have been a disaster. So many things are stacked against us. Even in the World Trade Organization, China is considered a developing nation. Therefore, they get tremendous, guess what? We don’t accept it. We’ve informed them, we don’t accept it. And we’re not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends.
    ID: 1070.0 Negative: And by the way, you’re a lot … Look at this guy over here. Look at the size of that guy. You’re a lot tougher than they are. Just so you understand that, right? Look at the size of that guy. But Biden and Harris are pro-crime and anti- cop. There’s no other way to say it. And we’re anti-crime, we are pro-cop all the way. I’ve gotten the endorsement. I got the endorsement. Pat Lynch, New York City police. They gave us an endorsement first time, I think. He said I think it’s the first time they’ve ever done it. That means it’s been a long time. They don’t do that kind of thing. They endorsed me. All the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me.
    ID: 1141.0 Negative: I used to use Venezuela a lot. I don’t know if I even really fully believed it but I’d say, “Venezuela, we would indeed become.” When I look at these maniacs in Portland, these anarchists in Portland, when I look at these people, that’s what they want for the rest of the country. They want to defund their police, they want to terminate their police. You know something about that. You’ve had your little stance where they want to … Did they actually do the, they actually are terminating the police department, right? They are actually doing it. They’re not even talking about it, they’re terminating the police department. These people are crazy, and by the way, when I sent in the National Guard, that’s when it all stopped and I kept calling. I kept calling and saying, “Send in the National Guard. Send in the National Guard.” They should have done it a lot sooner.
    ID: 662.0 Positive: 7) Very tough. The ventilator’s very complicated, very big, very expensive. It’s like, I made the statement, it’s like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, “No, it’s not.” They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s what we’ll do. Let me just tell you something. If they didn’t waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly.
    ID: 416.0 Positive: But we’re keeping those small trucks, and we’re keeping our whole industry good. And we’re expanding our autos now, our cars, and we’re doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job.
    ID: 714.0 Negative: No, I’m not saying that at all, but it does … There is a level of violence that you don’t see. So you have this beautiful community in the suburbs, including women, right? Women. They want security. I ended where they build low-income housing project right in the middle of your neighborhood. I ended it. If Biden gets in, he already said, it’s going to go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who’s going to be in charge of it? Cory Booker. That’s going to be nice. Okay. So I think that women are going to want me, well, for a lot of other reasons. The stock markets will crash. As sure as you’re sitting there, your 401(k)s will go down to a small percentage of what they are-
    ID: 900.0 Positive: Thank you very much. Thank you.
    ID: 1000.0 Positive: Think of it. You know what I did? I signed, as you know and as you’ve seen, I guess, but other countries have sometimes 10% of what we pay for the same exact pill, same drug, same prescription drug. And I signed a deal that we get, it’s not signed by the drug companies, they hate it. They’ll take in advertising. Whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies, just remember one thing, that means your prices are coming down. That means your prices. But it’s called Favored Nations, Favored Nations. We were the least favorite nation in the whole world. We paid the highest price. So I signed if Germany has an example, pays 25 cents for a pill and we pay $3 for the exact same pill, we pay 25 cents also. Now what means is they’re going to go up, we’re going to come way down.
    ID: 799.0 Negative: 0) How about his son? You think the son, maybe there’s a conflict? How about his son? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? Does anybody know? Where’s Hunter? He’s in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn’t be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And it’s not just Ukraine and it’s not just China. But he goes into China, takes out $1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn’t even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. It’s a disgrace, what’s happening.
    ID: 180.0 Positive: What I suggested was I would ask every person in authority. There’s a question whether or not a president, under the constitution, could mandate everyone wearing masks. And remember all during the primary, I’d have a lot of people telling me I would by executive order, do. I’m a constitutionalist. You can’t do things the Constitution doesn’t allow you the power to do. What I be doing is putting as much pressure as I could on every governor, every Senator, excuse me every mayor, every county executive, every local official, and everyone in business, putting pressure on them to say what you’re doing is irresponsible. Make sure you wear a mask and maintain social distancing. And the vast majority of the American people accept that notion.
    ID: 119.0 Negative: If you think a little bit about where we are right now, it’s been a terrible, terrible wake up call that’s gotten the rest of the nation to realize that the confluence of three things. One, the COVID crisis. Two, and we didn’t have to have over six million people contract COVID. Over 186,000 dead and climbing. If we had acted, if we’d had just acted. It’s been pointed out by the University of Columbia law school that if he had acted just one week earlier, 37,000 more people would have been alive. If he acted two weeks earlier, 51,000. Maybe 31 and 57 or 51 and … But the point is over 80,000 people would still be alive. You have to take responsibility if you’re a leader, a president. Instead of saying, “I’m not responsible, didn’t happen on my watch. I take no responsibility.”
    ID: 1238.0 Positive: I mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.
    ID: 633.0 Positive: 7) I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid $150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave $1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in $100 bills? It’s a lot, it’s like the size of this, right? Now think $1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately.
    ID: 406.0 Negative: But this guy Peters, right? Peters. I say, “Who’s Peters?” Nobody knows him. He doesn’t do anything. I mean, look, we’re going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. He’s been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything he’s ever done. And this is what he has.
    ID: 247.0 Negative: I want to thank Carnegie Mellon for providing this space and all the promise it holds for future jobs in the high tech world. In recent days, we’ve had a lot of talk about who’s going where and how I’ve decided to come to Pittsburgh to talk a little bit about what’s going on right now. In the early days of World War II, Franklin Roosevelt told the country, and I quote, “The news is going to get worse and worse before it gets better and better. And the American people deserve to have it straight from the shoulder.” Straight from the shoulder. The job of a president is to tell it straight from the shoulder, tell the truth, to be candid, to face facts, to lead, not to insight. That’s why I’m speaking to you today. The incumbant president is incapable of telling us the truth, incapable of facing the facts and incapable of healing. He doesn’t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat and he’s stroking violence in our cities.
    ID: 59.0 Negative: But look, would you really expect anything different from this guy? From someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform, who have given their lives to the country losers and suckers? Let me tell you something. My son Beau is an assistant US attorney. He volunteered to go to Kosovo to help them set up a government in the middle of the war. I know I’m being proud here, but he’s the only foreigner has a monument that they raised and built in service to him, thanking him for what he did. My son also then as attorney general volunteered to go to Iraq for one year. He wasn’t a loser or a sucker. No one who served this nation has been a loser or a sucker. They’re all heroes. Or would you expect anything different than someone who could stand next to a father of a fallen soldier and say at a cemetery and say, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” What was in it for them?
    ID: 186.0 Negative: The words of a president matter. Union. This pandemic has crushed our country. The sad thing is it didn’t have to be this bad. It’s not this bad in other countries. More than six million COVID cases in the United States, almost 200,000 deaths, projected to go much higher, and nearly 30 million on unemployment. That doesn’t count the seven million who are working part-time, who aren’t counted as unemployed, but still can’t buy the new tires for the car when they’re bald, still can’t take care of the basic things of getting the hot water heater fixed, et cetera; the things we talk about at our kitchen tables.
    ID: 239.0 Positive: This is about the future. This is the United States of America. Anytime we’ve ever set our mind to something, we’ve never failed, as long as we’ve done it together.
    ID: 1096.0 Negative: So time and again, sleepy Joe Biden put China first and America last, even to a point where his son who had absolutely… Where’s Hunter, has anyone seen Hunter? He’s had absolutely no experience, walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, that’s millions of dollars a year. And if you go to the pros of Wall Street, they’ll tell you it’s an impossibility. It was a 10 minute meeting. He walked away with one and a half billion from China. How do you think he’s going to do negotiating, Biden against China? Nobody’s done what I’ve done to China, to Russia. By the way, remember, we were going to be in a war with North Korea. What happened to the war? We’re getting along Kim Jong Un. We get along. Let’s see what happens. And meantime, it’s almost four years. Remember we were going to be in a war.
    ID: 655.0 Negative: 8) Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it’s the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he’s always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, “Oh, if he was,” well he didn’t want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didn’t do the closing and the opening, so we’re at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it’s a disgrace.
    ID: 111.0 Positive: We’ve also learned … And I’ll end with this. I know you’re getting too antsy. Sit down, man. Okay. [crosstalk 00:40:13] But this is important. Here’s the deal. If you think about it, we’ve finally figured out drug abuse doesn’t cause mental health problems. Mental health problems cause drug abuse. And if you don’t detect the anxiety in children early and deal with it and treat it, you increase exponentially the prospect that they’re going to in fact find themselves susceptible to what’s happening in the community.
    ID: 258.0 Negative: More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol. Nearly one in six small businesses have closed in this country today. Do oyu really feel safer under Trump? What about Trump’s plan to destroy the Affordable Care Act, and with it, the protections for preexisting conditions that impacts more than 100 million Americans? Does that make you feel safer? Or how about Trump’s plan to defund social security? The social security administration’s chief actuary just released a report saying that if a plan like the one Trump is proposing goes into effect, the social security trust fund would be, and I quote, “Permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023, with no ability to pay benefits thereafter.” To put it plainly, Trump’s plan with wipe out social security period. Do you feel safer and more secure now? The fear that reigns under this president doesn’t stop at our shores. The Kremlin has put bounties on the heads of American soldiers.
    ID: 1004.0 Positive: I think so. I think so. If we don’t, they did a lot of manipulation. Also, a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and maybe his grandfather. I don’t even know. I hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than I feel. I feel young. State GOP Chairman, Lawrence Tabas. What a great family. I miss Dan Tabas. You know that? Dan Tabas, what a great man he was. I don’t know if you know him, but he started out with about 2 cents and he ended up being a rich man. And he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine. That was long before I ran for politics. He didn’t like many people, but he liked Trump. Right? People would go, “He’s a rough guy.” People would go up to him and say, “Hi, Dan. How you doing?” He became a very successful guy. And he’d look out and say, “I don’t want to talk to anybody. I just want to talk to Trump.” I like that kind of a guy, right?
    ID: 29.0 Positive: I imagine it will be sometime this week. I just don’t know, but it will be a regular basis.
    ID: 798.0 Negative: He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. That’s not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First China’s stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you.
    ID: 224.0 Positive: I remember.
    ID: 433.0 Positive: Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, “How much are they being targeted for?” “Sir, $12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’re putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%.” Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, “You know what we’re going to do? We’re going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, $28 billion and we’re going to give it to our farmers who were targeted,” and our farmers are doing great. That’s what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that? He wouldn’t have a clue. Hillary wouldn’t have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldn’t have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that? We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury.
    ID: 720.0 Positive: And I said in the speech, some people would say, you shouldn’t say it. It’s too aggressive. I said, what’s aggressive? I’ve done more than any president in the United … in the history of our country, except for maybe Abe, and I say maybe, maybe, Abraham Lincoln. The reason I say maybe is I’ll explain that to you later. Okay?
    ID: 1089.0 Positive: Again, the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one. The most enthusiasm. So we got to get out and vote. You got to be careful with your ballots. Be careful, your absentee ballots great. Your others, you got to be very careful or go to vote. Just go to vote. Go to vote. We have a little problem here. You have a Democrat governor who is will do anything to turn things around. How’s Tom Tiffany doing, by the way? Another win, we just had a nice win, right? Tom is around here someplace. Tom Tiffany just had a great win. We’re winning a lot. We’ve won a lot of House seats. We’re going to definitely, we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House.
    ID: 647.0 Positive: 2) [inaudible 01:16:12] we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can’t be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it’s so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now.
    ID: 199.0 Negative: Unions are why so many today have health insurance and sick leave. Why so many have a voice in the workplace and our democracy. Unions are why the Cares Act included worker protection and why the Heroes Act, which the Senate hadn’t acted on yet, would require OSHA to boost safety standards. Unions shouldn’t have to go it alone. American workers deserve a partner in the White House, a president who’s on their side. Now Trump talks a big game, but let’s look at the facts. He threatened to veto the PRO Act, continuing to make it harder to organize on the job. He led federal contractors double. He talks about what he’s done now, right, in trade. He led federal contractors double offshoring, offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. He gave big tax cuts to corporations without making them bring jobs home.
    ID: 558.0 Positive: Whoa, that’s pretty good. We hit home with that one, huh?
    ID: 483.0 Negative: But I said that was going to happen. Don’t worry about it. You don’t have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It’s like a free fall. You know what, people don’t like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.
    ID: 889.0 Positive: 1) We will have strong borders. And I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.
    ID: 572.0 Positive: We will reassure our critical supply chains and we will bring back jobs in factories from China and other foreign polluters and everything we do will be guided by our love of this state, its people and its priceless natural treasures. It’s a great state. From its breathtaking beaches to its shimmering bays, from its vast marshes, all those beautiful marshes, marshlands, to its wild forests, there is truly no place on earth like the great state of Florida.
    ID: 1061.0 Positive: And in Ohio we went to a plant Whirlpool. They were out of business, they were going out of business and now they’re a thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it. And I said, “You want to do that? We’re putting a massive tariff.” And all of a sudden Whirlpool and thousands of people that work in Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again. And we went there. But if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have, we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016.
    ID: 337.0 Positive: I came first to know who Kamala was through our son, Beau Biden. They were friends. They served as attorneys general at the same time. They took on the same big fights together, Kamala in California, Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change the entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision. So now we need to get to work, pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in, getting our economy back on track, uniting this nation, and yes, winning the battle for the soul of America. My fellow Americans, now let me introduce to you for the first time, your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Kamala, the floor is yours.
    ID: 286.0 Positive: How are you? The name’s Joe.
    ID: 700.0 Negative: People that you’ve never heard of. People that are in the dark shadows. People that are-
    ID: 123.0 Negative: There’s a reason why this administration doesn’t want to talk about it, wants to only talk about dividing the country and about law and order. They don’t want to talk about all those people who have died from COVID. They don’t want to talk about the fact that almost a million people again file for unemployment, don’t have jobs. They don’t want to talk about the fact that you have tens of thousands of businesses closing, maybe for good. They don’t want to talk about the fact that the Congress passed legislation, Heroes Act, to provide money for states to be able to keep firefighters on the job, teachers on the job, first responders on the job, et cetera. They don’t want to talk about that because they don’t want to do it. They don’t feel it’s their obligation. So they’re trying to divert us the attention it’d have.
    ID: 883.0 Negative: Last year, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every town, city, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US government. Just think of that.
    ID: 602.0 Negative: The largest investment in your state’s history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It’s probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, “No, no, fracking’s okay, it’s okay? Did you see that? Fracking’s okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop.
    ID: 373.0 Negative: Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. He’s promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden’s pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto.
    ID: 688.0 Negative: So if it weren’t Donald Trump’s America, to just use the expression as I’m president, you would have riots like you’ve never seen. The Democrats have lost control of the radical left. And if you look at Bernie and the, I call it the manifesto that was agreed to with Biden and his crew, that’s further left than Bernie ever was. They won’t be able to control these people. These people have lost control of these people and it’s hurting them. Don’t forget, Biden wasn’t going to come out of his basement until the election. Now he had to because the polls are so good for me. Now he had two because the polls are different. So all of a sudden he’s in Pittsburgh. He wasn’t going to leave his basement. Then he said, “Okay,” he’s leaving. But he won’t leave for 10 days. 10 days is a long time. So in the meantime, like on Sunday, or Saturday, I’m in Texas, I’m in Louisiana. I was going to stop in two other places. Fortunately, they didn’t get hit. Arkansas wasn’t hit very much, et cetera, et cetera. I would have stopped. But I’m all over the place. I leave early in the morning. I get home late at night. And that’s what you have to do as president Joe doesn’t have energy.
    ID: 588.0 Positive: And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don’t get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There’s no bail. Don’t worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes.
    ID: 597.0 Positive: Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he’s got the worst location. I say, “Where’s John?” I’m looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He’s great. You’ve got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You’re the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That’s a great endorsement. That’s a great endorsement.
    ID: 967.0 Positive: It’s going to be a year of tremendous success. We’re fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we’re never going to forget it and I let them know. We’re never going to forget what they did because you know what? We’re going to do great economics [inaudible 00:51:42] best year in the history of your state, but we’re going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn’t move and if I didn’t put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn’t… and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn’t do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn’t believe.
    ID: 1053.0 Negative: Well, I want to thank you. Thank you. In the months ahead we will need every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism. We’re in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself. We are really in a fight. This is the most important election we’ve ever had in my opinion. And I used to say it and I’d say it with great conviction, 2016 but you know what? That wasn’t crazy people we were dealing. They were on the edge, crooked Hillary was on the edge. She was on the verge. She became crazy later on when she lost. That’s what she became. But these are people that are seriously radical left. Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet. He has no clue what’s happening.
    ID: 391.0 Positive: The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy.” I said, “No, I don’t want to amend it. I don’t want to do that. I want to get rid of it.” “Well, sir, why don’t we just do a simple amendment? It would be” … I said, “I want to get rid of it. End it.” And we ended it. We ended it.
    ID: 937.0 Negative: I give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was … It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn’t have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can’t let it happen. We can’t let it happen.
    ID: 136.0 Positive: 4) Amen [inaudible 01:14:04].
    ID: 734.0 Positive: Well, I said, look, if I’ve never had it, wouldn’t it be good? And then I thought I should have it because I’ll set an example. So I had it. So I’ve had it now three times, and I still haven’t had the flu. So maybe I’ll give credit to the flu vaccine. I don’t know.
    ID: 80.0 Positive: Can’t do that anymore. [crosstalk 00:00:45] You got some guns. All right.
    ID: 530.0 Negative: The time that we spent on this impeachment hoax, Nancy Pelosi with her hairdryer and the whole thing. “Everybody has to wear a mask. You must keep all beauty parlors closed.” Then she’s in a beauty parlor with no mask on. And then she said the biggest, the biggest [inaudible 00:10:31]. She could have said, “Okay.” She could have said, “You got me.” But she said, “I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,” who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, “I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.” I said, “How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?” No, it’s terrible, she’s always preaching about the mask. “You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.” I’ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I’m reelected the best is yet to come. I’ll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, “Walls are old fashioned. They don’t work.” Really? I always say, and I’ve said it four or five times. I’ll say it again if you’d like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you’re lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn’t it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall.
    ID: 611.0 Positive: If I were a psychiatrist, right? I’d say, “This guy’s got some big issues.” Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I don’t want to touch your damn mask. Mike I’ll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, “Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It’s incredible.” By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. “Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time.” You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn’t like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense?
    ID: 570.0 Positive: We’re rapidly restoring the greatest economy in history. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we had to close it up when the China plague came in, we closed it up. We saved millions of lives. We banned highly infected China from coming in, it was highly infected. The people were highly infected. Wu Han province, we banned them. Nobody said do it, everybody said I shouldn’t do it. Biden said, “Don’t do it,” three months later he admitted I was right. But we banned people, we would have lost hundreds of thousands more, but we would have lost millions if we didn’t close it up and now we open it up and we’re setting records at every single level. So we’re maintaining that pristine resource of beautiful, clean environment at every single community in Florida and all over the country. We’ll always defend the Everglades and we will always safeguard the magnificent Florida coastline. We’ll expand access for fishermen and sportsmen, we’ll uphold your right to hunt and we will protect your right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment.
    ID: 562.0 Positive: Thanks to my administration’s pro-American energy policies we can take this step and the next step while remaining the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, we’re the largest producer now in the world by far. We’re number one in the world and we are energy independent, which is a nice…
    ID: 810.0 Negative: 3) … be worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. And that’s going to be almost everybody. They’re saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. They’re going to be raising everybody’s taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we’re devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is.
    ID: 803.0 Positive: 6) Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. It’s already getting defeated.
    ID: 595.0 Positive: This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I’m delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don’t know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What I’m endorsing, I’m getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You’ve never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It’s been the Commonwealth’s greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth? Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That’s right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh?
    ID: 188.0 Positive: If I have the honor of becoming your president, I’m going to be the strongest labor president you have ever had. I’m going to make sure we enact the PRO Act, which by the way, Trump had promised when he ran, he would do, and then he threatened to veto if it got passed out of the Senate.
    ID: 616.0 Positive: On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who’s very popular. Do we like our First Lady? Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, “Darling, are you okay?” I go, “Why do you ask?” She said, “They’re reporting that you had a heart attack.” Now you have to understand I’m driving in a car, which is about what? Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. They’re a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they’re right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn’t work. No it’s unbelievable.
    ID: 490.0 Negative: And it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. It’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don’t you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he’s going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I’m telling you, you’d have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It’s a disgrace, but let’s see what happens. Biden’s a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities.
    ID: 227.0 Positive: My dad came back to Scranton after the war. At one point, I remember he made what I call, and a lot of parents have done it, the longest walk a parent can make up a short flight of stairs, and say, “Honey, we’re not going to be able to go to that school next year. You can’t play on that Little League team. Dad doesn’t have a job now.” And I remembered that happening, and we were going home and live with my grandpop and my uncle in the home that my mom was raised in. I thought about how much pride it must’ve cost my dad to walk into my grandpop Finnegan’s pantry and say, “Ambrose, can you take the kids and Jean,” my mom, “For a year live here. And I promise I’ll make it up.” And we moved to a place called Claymont, Delaware, but it took my dad, we moved when I was in third grade, and it wasn’t until seventh grade we were able to buy a home and a new “development.”
    ID: 1149.0 Positive: Because we will defeat the China virus, we’re going to be stronger than we ever were. Next year is going to be record setting numbers and you see that when you look at the V. The V is turning out to be true. I was saying a V and everybody was saying a V is impossible but the V, it’s beyond a V, it’s a super V based on the numbers that we have now. So we’ll see what happens and we would like to give additional money to people. We would like to … It wasn’t their fault that they got hit by China but you know what? We want to give them additional money and we’ll take care of … Again, the Post Office has been a disaster for many, many decades. We want to strengthen the Post Office, make it good. It lost $78 billion over a relatively short number of years. $78 billion, I want to strengthen the Post Office and we can do it so that if you look, Amazon and all these companies that now do, it’s a whole new business, they just drop a lot of it right into the Post Office and we lose two and three –
    ID: 48.0 Negative: He knowingly and willingly lied about the threaded pose to the country for months. He had the information. He knew how dangerous it was. Now, while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the American people. Experts say that if he had acted just one week sooner, 36,000 people would have been saved. If he acted two weeks sooner, back in March, 54,000 lives would have been spared in March and April alone. His failure has not only costs lives. He sent our economy in a tailspin. It costs millions more in American livelihoods. This is a recession created by Donald Trump’s negligence. And he is unfit for this job as a consequence of it. How many schools aren’t open right now? How many kids are starting a new school year the same way they ended the last one at home?
    ID: 442.0 Negative: We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right? Think of it. We did more and it’s true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true.
    ID: 1024.0 Positive: After eight long years, Joe Biden and Barack Obama left America weak, disrespected, and endangered. We are respected again. We are a respected country again. They said that one of the leaders called up, top top leader of one of the countries. He asked me to call President Erdogan of Turkey, who I get along with very well. He said, “Sir, please, would you do me a favor? Call Erdogan.” I said, “Why can’t you do it?” He says, “You’re the only one he respects. You’re the only person he respects.” I tell you this story. I like telling very personal stories. But they did say that. “You’re the only one he’ll listen to.” I said, “Is that because of the United States?” They said, “No, it’s because of you.” So that’s not so bad. I might as well. I might as well tell you the stories because they won’t.
    ID: 508.0 Positive: You know Mexico is paying for the wall just so you understand. They don’t say that. They never say it, but we’re going to charge a small fee at the border, the toll booths. We have toll booths. It’s the biggest border in the world in terms of people going across and in terms of industry, believe it or not, the southern border. We’re putting a small toll on and maybe we’re going to do something with remittance. That’s when people come here, make money and they send it back, so we’ll do something and we’re going to get all the money that we spent on the wall will be coming back so … Remember I used to say who’s going to pay for it? They’d say Mexico [inaudible 00:29:47]? That’s right. Mexico is going to pay for it.
    ID: 46.0 Positive: And if you’re wondering what responsible strong executive leadership looks like in COVID-19, just look at this executive right here. Governor, you’ve done an incredible job steering the people of Michigan through a turbulent time. Much of it is brought on by Donald Trump’s lack of leadership. You’ve been rock solid, governor. You’ve listened to the experts and you’ve led with science and you put the needs of the people, who are hurting first, helping them get through this crisis.
    ID: 978.0 Negative: If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America. You’re not going to have law and order. Do you notice? And I shouldn’t say it because he’ll put it in his speech, if he can read it, which I doubt. But they’ll put it in there tonight. I shouldn’t say it because he’s going to speak later. He’s going to have a good audience. People are going to find out what the hell’s going on. I see he hasn’t answered a question since, they just said … Did you see it on the newscasts? Since July 17th. Hasn’t taken a question from the fake news back there. No, think of it.
    ID: 986.0 Negative: Now, I don’t know if they’re embarrassed or what, but these Democrat cities, they’re out of control. They have none. Look at Seattle, where she said, no, we want a summer of love. I mean, this woman is crazy, and they would have never taken back Seattle except they knew we were going in the next day. That’s the only reason they even did it. So tonight we have slow Joe will speak at the Democrat Convention, and I’m sure that he’ll just knock them dead.
    ID: 1108.0 Negative: It’s incredible. He’s in there for 47 years, he does nothing. Now all of a sudden, he’s going to do all these things. He’s going to get tough on China. Sure. China will own the United States if we don’t make this deal and we will [inaudible 00:51:00] if we don’t get elected, China will own the … mark by word. Well, I hope you’re not going to be able to test it out. China will own the United States. Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama. They got $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash, green cash for nothing. We got nothing out of that deal. And I terminated that deal. I terminated that deal. And we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That’s for the evangelicals. It’s amazing with that. The evangelicals are more excited about that than Jewish people. It’s incredible. But we did, we did that. And Golan Heights, don’t forget Golan Heights. We did Golan Heights. So we’ve done a lot. In February, Biden said, “If you elect me your taxes are going to be raised. They’re not going to be cut.” Now [inaudible 00:07:05], how the hell do you do this? That will [inaudible 00:07:09]. Only in this state can we get away with it, but you happen to be right. You happen to be right. So I just want to say this. This has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you. I’ve been here a lot. We won this state. We weren’t expected to win this state.
    ID: 735.0 Positive: If I can say this. I think we’re going to have a vaccine very soon. A lot of tremendous work has been done. We’re going to have a vaccine, just like we have therapeutics, which to me are even more important. You go into the hospital, you make people better. That’s to me the most, and we just did the convalescent plasma, I think. And you have other things too. So I think we’re going to have a lot of therapeutics and we’re going to have a vaccine very soon as to whether or not people take it-
    ID: 163.0 Positive: What I’d be doing is I’d be bringing people together in the White House, right now. I’d be having that Police Commission set up. I’d have law enforcement at the table. I’d have the community at the table. I’d have people and saying, “How do we get through this? What do we do to deal with this?” Because I believe the vast majority of the community at writ large, as well as law enforcement, want to straighten things out, not inflamed things, but this president keeps throwing gasoline on the fire, every place he goes.
    ID: 563.0 Negative: With fracking, the shale revolution and the tremendous surge in American energy production, we’re showing that we can create jobs, safeguard the environment and keep energy prices low for America and low for our citizens and you see that, you also see it when you pump the gas into your car and you’re paying sometimes a lot less than $2.00 Lately, right? So we’re doing well and we have so much of it. I don’t know, we got more than everybody, anybody ever thought possible, right? That’s really incredible what’s happened. The approach of Joe Biden and the radical left is exactly the opposite. Their policies will destroy jobs, cause energy prices to double and triple and quadruple, to skyrocket beyond belief and the environment will be badly hurt. If you go by that, badly, badly hurt, it will be injured and permanently injured. And very importantly, they’ll take away our energy independence and they’ll do it quickly and they won’t even know what happened to them.
    ID: 723.0 Negative: Super predators, actually. He called them super predators.
    ID: 579.0 Positive: I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market’s at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we’re rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that they’ve done, the doctors, everybody else, we’re years ahead of schedule. Anybody else’s President, you wouldn’t be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I’ll tell you right now. That I can tell you.
    ID: 888.0 Positive: 4) We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. And it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities, and ensure federal health care is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.
    ID: 92.0 Positive: And I said, don’t tell me these can’t change. And I told the story and pointed, reminded them what it was when I was a young attorney. But I made a mistake about something. I thought you could defeat hate. Hate only hides. It only hides. And when someone in authority breathes oxygen under that rock, it legitimizes those folks to come on out, come out in front of the rocks. And I hadn’t planned on running for anything again after my son had died. I was a professor at college and running another program at another college. Until I saw those people coming out of Charlottesville, carrying torches, literally torches coming out of the fields. Close your eyes. Remember what you saw on television. Their veins bulging, their hateful speech, chanting the same antisemitic bile that was chanting in the streets of Germany in the 30s. On top of that, accompanied by white supremacists, Klu Klux Klan. A young woman was killed protesting those folks.
    ID: 1071.0 Positive: What you have all of the law enforcement in Texas endorsed me. We’re getting endorsement from … We haven’t found anybody that won’t endorse in law enforcement. We haven’t found anybody, and if we do, I think they’d probably be in big trouble. I really do. I think they’d be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out. We are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people. These are great Americans. These are people that want our people to be safe. So, we’re thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs from across the state, and I am deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than three dozen Wisconsin sheriffs. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, fellas. They’re good looking people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like that mask. MAGA. I wonder if he supports Trump? He’s got MAGA this big. I wonder if he’s a Trump … Hey, thank you, sheriffs. We appreciate it. Good looking guys. Good looking guys.
    ID: 884.0 Negative: Liberal politician’s claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by Radical Left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. That is what is happening. And it has been going on from before I even got elected. And remember this, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens.
    ID: 64.0 Positive: First, we’re going to impose a tax penalty on companies that avoid paying US taxes by off shoring jobs and manufacturing, only to sell those goods back to the American consumer. If your big corporate strategy is to boost your shareholders profits, your CEOs’ bonuses by moving jobs out, well, we’re going to make sure you not only pay full US taxes on those profits, but we’re going to guarantee. We’re going to add a 10% off shoring penalty surge tax to your bill. No more deductions for writing off expenses for the cost of sending jobs overseas, which is a big deal that could be done here at home by qualified American workers. I’m not looking to punish American business, but there’s a better way. Make it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren. That’s what this is about.
    ID: 859.0 Positive: Many Americans, including me, I have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary. In their honor, we unite. In their memory, we will overcome it. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produce the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike. Please stand up.
    ID: 756.0 Positive: And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. It’s a disgrace. And our country is going to change. We’re not going to allow that to happen. You know, we’re not supposed to be… We’re not supposed to be involved unless we’re invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So we’re not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that’s a big statement. It’s a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, we’re going to have to look at it because we’re not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country.
    ID: 159.0 Negative: Well, I think my message is getting out based on what the polling data shows and the millions of people who’ve watched, what I’ve had to say and the circumstance which I’ve said it. But I would like to get out more. But I think a president has a responsibility to set examples, set the right example for how to get out. Not go out and not wear a mask and not to have large crowds of people standing next to one of their not wearing masks, not being a potential called room for significant outbreaks of COVID. And so what I’ve done is I’ve met with, via what I did this morning with the medical experts.
    ID: 931.0 Positive: But if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it’s going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I’m up by massive numbers, not just a little. I’m also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I’m up by massive, and when I say I’m up, I’m talking about we’re up. Okay. So if you could [inaudible 00:23:10].
    ID: 459.0 Negative: 6) The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we’re having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. We’re trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals.
    ID: 1139.0 Positive: I just saw, the great thing about Air Force One, there’s no lack of television. You have televisions on the ceilings, in the closets, on the floors. No matter where you go, there’s a television. You open the closet, there’s a television. I say, “No, too much Trump. I can’t watch it anymore.” I try and get away, you put yourself in a closet. But they have a lot of stuff and they showed this person getting on FOX, you know FOX now puts on more Democrats just about than they do Republicans. They have certainly changed a lot. FOX has changed a lot. They’re probably turning off right now as I speak but I don’t … See I don’t care. I tell the truth. It’s ridiculous.
    ID: 145.0 Negative: Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos, Secretary DeVos, haven’t stepped up and we’re all seeing the results. Millions of students are now starting the new school year in the same way they finished the last one, at home. At home. Parents are doing their best, but more and more, were finding themselves at wit’s end, struggling to balance work and childcare and educational duties, or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they’ll make ends meet while trying to keep their kids on track with remote learning.
    ID: 1084.0 Positive: Thanks to my administration’s policies, we’re now witnessing the fastest … And you’ve seen this, right? The fastest economic recovery in the history of our country. Over the past three months, we have already gained much more than nine million jobs nationwide. That’s a record. That’s not even close by the way.
    ID: 130.0 Positive: 2) I think there is a chance for a real awakening here. And the point is, I don’t think we have any alternative, but to fight. I don’t think we have any alternative, but to fight back. [inaudible 01:05:28] alternative than just go tell the truth, just tell the truth. And a concluding comment I’ll make is, there’s a lot of folks who thought that, well, the president’s made great strides with his law and order strides here.
    ID: 434.0 Positive: And we’re still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, “No, you got to leave the tariffs on.” A lot of people didn’t know it. Schumer went, “Well, I don’t like to do …” First of all, he didn’t like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it.
    ID: 86.0 Positive: First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity. And I hope, I don’t know how much time you have after I say a few words, maybe I can hear from more of you as well. But let me respond to a little bit of what I’ve heard so far. First of all, I can make a generic point. The words of a president matter. No matter if they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. No matter how competent or incompetent a president is, they can send the nation to war, they can bring peace, they can make markets rise or fall, and they can do things that I’ve observed can make a difference just by what they say.
    ID: 300.0 Positive: One of the things that I admire about you, is you keep talking about what I call equity. Just decency, fairness. Treating people with respect. John Lewis used to say, “The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool you have. Use the power to change for the change you want by voting.” Look, I’m a lot older than you, to state the obvious. When I was in high school, what happened was we had the civil rights movement was just being started. And what happened? Along came Bull Connor and his dogs. He thought he was going to drive a wooden stake into the heart of the civil rights movement.
    ID: 1039.0 Positive: But you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out, and so instead of having it like on for many times longer … Actually when I take a shower, I can have water hit my hair instead of drop, drop. It’s hard enough my hair without that. So now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads. Okay? So a lot of good things. We’ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about, nobody writes about, but it’s about quality of life, and I think the people really appreciate it. I really do. Not so easy to do. Not so easy to do. I don’t think anybody else could have done it. Nobody else would have thought to do things like that, but nobody else would have done it.
    ID: 31.0 Negative: Because presidents United States should be presidential and should lead by example, as well as make clear exactly where they stand. Getting down in the gutter like the president does saying things that I’d be inclined, if we were behind a barn somewhere, it’d be a different thing. But that’s not the job of a president. The job of a president sets an example. My anger is real because I must tell you, I carry and I deliberately didn’t bring it with me today. The Delaware National Guard had a pin made up. That’s a gold star that was made up for my son, Beau, who didn’t die in the field. And I always carry it with me and I didn’t carry it today because I was worried that if I focus too much on it, that I would engage in some of the kind of language the president’s used. I mean, but I just think it is sick. It is deplorable. It is so un-American. It is so unpatriotic.
    ID: 173.0 Negative: But this administration seems to think it’s all of a sudden going to go away, like angel dust is going to be sprayed around. Everything’s going to be okay. I just don’t get it. They have to know better. They have to know better. We had an example, just the last administration, how much good you can do and how much growth you can generate. I just don’t get these guys. I really, don’t. Not a joke. I’ve been doing this a long time, but I’ve never seen a president lack as much leadership, unwilling, an inability to make a deal. You got about, I’m told the reason why they can’t get anything done in the Republican Congress, is 20 members of the United States Senate saying under no circumstances, will they raise the deficit at all.
    ID: 899.0 Positive: 9) I love you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.
    ID: 1190.0 Positive: 4) We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to respect our great American flag. We will never waiver in defense of our families, our values, our faith, our jobs, our borders, our rights, or our freedoms. Together we will unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed as one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
    ID: 87.0 Positive: I got out of law school and I moved back to Delaware. I had a partial scholarship to go away. We didn’t have a law school at the time in Delaware. I went to Syracuse Law School. When I came home from law school, what happened was my last semester, the only two political heroes I ever had, both were assassinated. Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy. Matter of fact, Kennedy was assassinated the day I graduated. I came home and my city is the only city in the United States of America occupied by the military since reconstruction for 10 months. Every single corner with someone, a military person standing with a drawn bayonet. Not a joke, 10 months. I had a job with a good law firm, a well known law firm, one of the oldest law firms in the state. And after awhile, I concluded that I was in the wrong place. They were good people, but I quit and became a public defender.
    ID: 936.0 Positive: China tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they’ve had in decades and decades and we had the best year we’ve ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 25 cents from China, never took in 25 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States.
    ID: 15.0 Positive: He should be doing his job of calling congressional leaders together immediately to get a deal and deliver real results for the American people. This is the first president in the middle of a crisis I’ve never seen has called Congress into the Oval Office. If I were president, that’s what I’d do and I’d get it done like previous presidents. Rentals, food, unemployment assistance, tens of millions struggling Americans, student loan reliefs, small business support, and aid to schools and state governments that are going bankrupt. And as long as this pandemic and the economic catastrophe persist, no one should have their water or power cut off because they can’t afford to pay the bill. Bottom line, Mr. President, do your job, get off your golf course and out of the sand bunker, call the leaders together in the Oval Office, sit with them and make a deal. Make a deal that delivers for working Americans and eases their anxiety and pain. In July, I laid out my Build Back Better plan for an economy that works for everyone. Over the next three weeks I’ll be laying out the sharp contrast my plan has with the president’s non-plans. I’ll be asking American people three basic questions, who can handle a pandemic? Who can keep their promises? And who cares about and will fight for working families? Like the people here at West End, throughout this pandemic, they found their way to keep the center open safely and provide for critical services. No one here has been laid off. They adjusted their spaces for social distancing. They started a lending program to help local businesses, hair salons, and other small businesses. They continue their childcare services, which is critical for so many working families.
    ID: 205.0 Positive: I was one of the first ones to argue he invoke the act. He took so long and he only did it partially. Require OSHA to boost safety standards, rehiring the investigators that Trump let go, protecting whistleblowers, extending OSHA coverage to all, and I say all, public employees. Provide paid sick and emergency leave for everyone, whether you work in a big company or a small non-profit. Keep families whole. Expand PPP. Require companies that get bailouts like airlines to keep workers on the payroll or they don’t get the bailout. No more no strings attached money. Extend unemployment insurance for as long as this crisis lasts. Boost rent relief. Suspending evictions isn’t enough. You have to keep families and landlords from wracking up bankrupting debts. What happens in six months when all of a sudden, the six months or seven months of rent comes due? Or what happens to that landlord, particularly the small ones, who aren’t going to be able to keep the place open? Cancel $10,000.00 in student debt per person while this COVID is going on. They can’t afford to pay it back.
    ID: 759.0 Positive: … couple of our buildings, including a courthouse. Can you believe it? We send in because they can’t protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, “Please send in the National Guard.” just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that? The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and that’s what they ought to do.
    ID: 643.0 Negative: 8) They have no enthusiasm. So I said, “So that’s unfair. That guy walks and then they’ll have somebody knock on the door, say, “Listen, I would like your ballot.” “I don’t want to vote. I don’t care about Biden. I’m a Democrat. I don’t care about this guy.” “Well look, where is it?” “Here take it, blah blah blah.”” They even have a provision where you don’t have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that’s where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don’t have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it’s not, I hope we have a landslide like you’ve never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we’re going to win Nevada, except where they’re sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It’s very unfair, it’s very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I want to see the results of the election on November 3.
    ID: 817.0 Positive: 9) We will surprise medical billing require, it’s already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is? Do you know how big that is? Where you’re able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it? Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people don’t like it. It’s the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I’ve already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it.
    ID: 55.0 Negative: President Trump’s answered all this as the same as he’s answered everything. Corporate tax giveaways that actually ward off shoring. You heard me right. Giveaways that reward offshoring. If you offshore, you get more tax breaks. His 2017 tax bill slashed taxes on companies that sent production and jobs overseas. Those corporations then make huge profits by shipping these foreign made products back to the United States to sell to American consumers. And no industry has taken a greater advantage of Trump’s offshoring tax loopholes than the pharmaceutical industry.
    ID: 426.0 Negative: Would anybody here not take that deal? Anybody? Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Biden’s elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported.
    ID: 45.0 Positive: So I want to thank you again, UAW region one, for hosting me today. And it’s great to see Senator Stabenow. My good friend, Debbie Stabenow. Got a chance to spend a little time with the governor, but Senator Stabenow and I worked together on an awful lot of matters over the years in the United States Senate. She was a great partner to me when I was vice president and we worked in lockstep to get the people in Michigan back on their feet. We’re joined by one of the best and brightest and hardest working governors around, my friend, Gretchen Whitmer.
    ID: 265.0 Negative: Trump has sought to remake this nation in his image. Selfish, angry, dark, and divisive. This is not who we are. At her best, america’s always been, and if I have anything to do it, it will be again, generous, confident, an optimistic nation full of hope and resolve. Donald Trump is determined to instill fear in America. That’s what his entire campaign for the president has come down to, fear. But I believe Americans are stronger than that. I believe we’ll be guided by the words of Pope John Paul II, words drawn from the scriptures. Be not afraid, be not afraid. Fear never builds the future, but hope does. And building the future is what America does, what we’ve always done. In fact, it’s what we have done best and continue to do best. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity when we decide to do it together. So let’s get together. I want to thank you all. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops.
    ID: 439.0 Positive: Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. We’ve ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, we’ve already built over 310 miles of border wall. It’s all going to be finished very quickly. We’re averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. It’ll be finished very short.
    ID: 771.0 Positive: I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, “What am I doing tomorrow night?” You’re going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy? I don’t have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and you’ve been very good to me. You’ve been very good to me.
    ID: 347.0 Positive: I’m going to protect Obamacare and build on it with a public option, so every single person can have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. When it comes to fighting this pandemic, we have to be crystal clear. Everyone gets free access to testing and treatment. And when it’s available, a vaccine, everyone gets it. We have to fight this virus without regard to immigrant status. That’s the only way we’re going to beat this thing. And it’s only humane thing to do.
    ID: 232.0 Positive: You’re on judiciary committee. When I got there as a young man, I was put on judiciary and ended up being chairman of that committee for a long time. And one of the things I was really proud of was the first time I was able to get the Voting Rights Act extended 25 years. We thought, boy, we’ve made it. Then along came that famous case that occurred-
    ID: 583.0 Positive: I think we’re way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there’s far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It’s stronger. And we’ve done the greatest job. Again, if we didn’t get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn’t have needed a rally. That’s a little bit unfair, but that’s okay. That’s what China’s done to our nation. They’ve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave $28 billion, right, $28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy.
    ID: 744.0 Positive: Okay. He’s been here for many, many years, but you inherit a lot of people. It’s part of the machinery and you have some you love, some you don’t. I like him, I don’t agree with him that often, but I like him.
    ID: 326.0 Positive: As a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, she’s been the center, in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces. Well aware, well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them. As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and Indian-American in the United States of America. Her story is America’s story, different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials. She has worked hard, she has never backed down from a challenge, and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained. Many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in her way but never quit, and this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents.
    ID: 393.0 Positive: Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared” … At first, they’ll go crazy. And then they’ll say, “Okay, it’s time now to be reasonable.” They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, “What’s going to bring you together?” And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn’t speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things.
    ID: 13.0 Negative: And if your stocks soar as families teeter on the brink of hunger and homelessness and our president calls that success, what does that say about what he values? When you see the world in such a narrow prism, it’s no wonder he doesn’t see nearly 30 million Americans on unemployment, one in six small businesses that closed right now. He doesn’t understand what life is like for people walking by their boarded up shops, educators afraid that doing their job, that job they love, will bring the virus home to the people they love, or of parents searching for health insurance now that the furlough has turned into a layoff. It’s no wonder he doesn’t see the single mom forced to wait in the three hour food line so for the first time in her life, so she can feed her family because she’s now part of the one in six households with children that don’t have enough to eat. He wants us to believe that we’re doing better, to keep it up and not-
    ID: 707.0 Negative: Okay. I have to be aggressive because I’m like standing here in a sea of incompetent people, stupid people, and violent people. Very violent.
    ID: 221.0 Positive: Well, you and I are going to have a lot to do, but I think we can do it. I talked to you about how Barack and I worked it, and he asked me, “Is there anything that I wanted once I agreed to do it?” And I said, “Yeah, I do. I’d like to be able to be the last person in the room when every important decision you make.” And that’s what I’d like you to do. I like you to be the last, because I’m confident you will tell me the truth about what you think even if you disagree. And I’m confident that your judgment is really good.
    ID: 1075.0 Positive: So, we have some great friends with us tonight. I want to thank representative Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. And Jim Sensenbrenner is around here someplace. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, Jim. These guys are warriors. Also, a woman who did so great, she was so great in Michigan. She headed up Michigan. And a Republican hadn’t won Michigan in many, many years. And we got a lot of car companies building right now in Michigan. Don’t we? Ronna McDaniel, Ronna McDaniel. We won Michigan. I said, “Get me the woman that kept calling me in Michigan. You have to come one more time, sir.” I said, “This is it.” Then I’d leave and she’d call the next day. “One more time.” But you know, she did a great job. Thank you very much. Ronna’s fantastic. Head of the RNC.
    ID: 364.0 Negative: This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan’s jobs, outsourcing-
    ID: 375.0 Negative: Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You’re upper class. You’re the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they’re really elite. I see them. They’re not elite. You’re the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven’t we now? You’re the super elite.
    ID: 129.0 Positive: 8) Anybody know these things? Because we don’t teach him. We’ve got to give people facts, teach them what’s out there, the idea. I just spent time with a number of the NFL players and basketball… And excuse me, basketball players, including Steph Curry. These folks are making a difference. Now it’s not about fame or glory, because they have brothers themselves. Fathers who’ve been beat up. Who’ve been brutalized just because they’re African-Americans. They’re about the time. They’re saying, I’m saying, “Enough is enough.”
    ID: 1242.0 Positive: I used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country.
    ID: 370.0 Positive: With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, “Who was that?” He said, “I don’t know, sir.” I said, “Play it back.” I said, “That man is going to be a star.” It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he’s a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren’t so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, “This guy” and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear you’re even, and maybe even ahead, and we’re going to win with John James. He’s a great guy, but I’m going to introduce him in a second.
    ID: 421.0 Negative: Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, “I better get out of the basement.” This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I can’t believe, oh they’re giving him hell tonight. They’re giving him hell. What did you say that for? Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. ‘Joe Hiden.’ Look, this doesn’t sound nice. I’ll say it, and they’ll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him? I’d have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Don’t do that to me, Michigan. Don’t do that.
    ID: 318.0 Positive: But again, when I get occasionally confronted with a person in the public about wearing a mask, I say, “Look, this is America. Be a Patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up. Do the right thing. Do the right thing.” There’s overwhelming evidence that the mask and depending on the type of mask you wear increases exponentially the prospect that you, if you are a carrier and you don’t even know it, that you will not infect anyone when you cough, sneeze, sing, shout.
    ID: 1116.0 Negative: You will deliver a historic victory for our values, our citizens and our treasured way of life. We’ll save our cities in our suburbs from the future of crime and chaos, corruption, and economic collapse that puppet Joe Biden would unleash on America. This is a puppet. He won’t do it intentionally. He just says, “Well, whatever they want.” Because he has no clue. He has no clue.
    ID: 1164.0 Negative: Furthermore, Joe Biden has pledged to increase refugee resettlement by not a bad number, 700%. You read that, right? That’s in the manifesto. He would overwhelm Minnesota with refugees, from terror hotspots, depleting public services, burdening schools, and straining city budgets. You already know about the hotspots, don’t you? You know about it. You’re having plenty of problems in Minnesota. And I’m going to be so politically correct, I’m not going to say a thing, but I know all about your hotspots, you got some hotspots. Very unfair to Minnesota, I will tell you that. And I’ll tell you, if I don’t win Minnesota, I’m never going to do it if I run for a third or fourth term, okay? I’ll never be back if I run, I’ve given up. I almost won last time. One more speech, Mike? almost won. I went to Michigan, I had a choice. I shouldn’t tell you this, but we won Michigan. One more speech, I would’ve won. I was so close, but if I don’t win it this time, I’m not coming back, never. Not for term three, four, five, or six.
    ID: 825.0 Positive: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
    ID: 461.0 Positive: 3) And in conclusion, although I hate, I really do, I hate to conclude, I hate to conclude because I love being with you, I do. I do. So, in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ve been doing it [inaudible 01:17:41]. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that’s already happening.
    ID: 546.0 Positive: 4) If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We’re far ahead of what I had planned. We’re far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn’t do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won’t believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, “Wow, things are going really well.” It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it’ll happen again. There’ll be great unity, eventually there’ll be great unity.
    ID: 77.0 Positive: Hi.
    ID: 1234.0 Negative: And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.
    ID: 857.0 Negative: As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission that took out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Suleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That is why China supports Joe Biden, and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information.
    ID: 568.0 Negative: The contrast between our vision and the radical left has never been more clear. They talk a big game and they do nothing. That’s really what it is, too. They talk and talk the environment, they talk and talk, nothing happens. It’s all talk. It’s all words and no action. You ever hear that?
    ID: 1170.0 Negative: Top Democrats have demanded the defunding of police departments. Biden even referred to the police at the enemy. And that’s what it is. He’s not going to control… look, he’s not going to control the situation. He’s dealing with… how about the congress woman that I watched over weekend, right? Saying, “I have total control over Biden. He’ll do anything I say. I have total control.” What she’s saying is, “I have total control over this jerk. He’ll do whatever the hell I want.” That’s putting it in more common language. But she said just as mean as that.
    ID: 791.0 Positive: You haven’t noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didn’t think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don’t want to give me a wall. So they’re going crazy. “Wall. The wall’s not getting done.” Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. I’m a developer. I know how to get money. It’s one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, it’ll be soon complete. And it’s the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that it’s built, you never hear about the wall. They don’t talk about it anymore. They don’t talk about it anymore. It’s incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force.
    ID: 856.0 Negative: We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They did not want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.
    ID: 540.0 Negative: 2) He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn’t believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they’re gone. And they’ve been incredible.
    ID: 1166.0 Positive: And remember, they say we don’t have it, we do have it. They understand that, they just don’t want to say it. We have a ban, you know that. We have a ban on people coming into our country illegally, we have a ban on countries, because we want people to come into our country who love our country, who can love our country, who respect our country, and who are going to come in on merit, merit, merit, which is the exact opposite of what was happening. Many of them hated our country and they didn’t come in on merit. All they do is complain. Do you know anybody like that? They just complain. Does anybody know anybody like that? Do you know anybody? One of your colleagues? You call her a colleague? All she does is complain. I won’t mention the name, because you’ll never guess, complains, complains, complains. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. All she does is complain, “Not good enough!” Oh really? Tell us about it.
    ID: 1204.0 Negative: So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.
    ID: 1060.0 Positive: I just got back from Texas and Florida and Ohio. We were all over the place. We went to great states and every roadway and highway, we had thousands, tens of thousands. I would say at least on each one a hundred thousand people from the plane, because that’s why this isn’t a rally. This is again, friendly protest. We were not allowed to do rallies, right? Because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to. But from the plane to an oil well, from the plane to getting law enforcement, all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement
    ID: 1199.0 Negative: If Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that [ inaudible 00:03:32]. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty.
    ID: 877.0 Positive: Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
    ID: 560.0 Positive: thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
    ID: 748.0 Positive: How are you, everybody? We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But I’m thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States.
    ID: 169.0 Positive: In addition to that, in the future, the idea, this has brought home a number of glaring problems we have in America, this whole pandemic, and what’s happened in terms of jobs. The idea that we’re in a situation where you have so many parents who have to make the difficult choice as a single parent or both working parents, to decide whether one gives up their salary and stays home with a child under the age of five or six, and/or somehow leaves them with somebody that there’s not particularly qualified and goes to work so they can earn a living, is a choice that is not, we shouldn’t be making.
    ID: 667.0 Positive: 0) We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don’t want surprise medical billing. You know what happens? It’s terrible, but we have ended it. Also, we’ve signed something that’s incredible. You’re going to see. Some people say it’s bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It’s called price transparency.
    ID: 431.0 Positive: But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office? It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, China’s paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didn’t pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money? I gave it to our farmers. I don’t know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here? We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. That’s not bad
    ID: 350.0 Positive: Trump fails to understand the basic truth of immigrants. That they’re the incredible source of our nation’s strength and they always have been. All the way back to the 1860s, when my Irish ancestors jumped on coffin ships in the Irish sea, not knowing where they are going, not knowing whether they’re going to make it to the shore all the way to today. There’s the reason we’ve been able to constantly renew and remake ourselves because we’ve been able to cherry pick the best of every culture. It takes courage to leave and come here from every continent, from every background. That’s why we’re who we are.
    ID: 408.0 Positive: So John, I’m with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe you’re going to make it. You’re running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. It’s ridiculous. Don’t do it.
    ID: 62.0 Positive: A lot of folks were all ready to count Detroit out as well as the auto American industry to count it out. But I knew what Debbie knew. I’ve known always. It’s never a good bet to bet against the American worker. So when we promise to stand with the American auto industry, we delivered. We didn’t do it to help wealthy investors or pad bonus checks for CEOs, we did it to save an iconic American industry, a testament to the skills and ingenuity of American manufacturing. And the jobs of hundreds of thousands of American workers and the lifeblood of communities all across the Midwest, and used to be in my state of Delaware as well. When Detroit declared bankruptcy, I was right here working alongside the city leaders to get the lights turned back on to revitalize the future of Detroit.
    ID: 374.0 Negative: He’s also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, it’s over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder.
    ID: 94.0 Positive: And what it did though, it also exposed what had not been paid enough attention to, the underlying racism that is institutionalized in the United States still exists, has existed for 400 years. So what’s happened is that we end up in a circumstance like you had here in Kenosha and have here in Kenosha. But I had a serious operation years ago in neurosurgeon and he gave me a relatively small chance of making it after it was all over. I said, “I’ll be fine.” And he said, “You know what your problem is, Senator?” He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”
    ID: 1180.0 Positive: I also want to send our special thanks to the members of the Minnesota National Guard who did such an incredible job stopping the rioting, violence, mayhem in Minneapolis. They were great. They were great. I love them. I love that. It’s just a beautiful thing. It’s the way it’s supposed to work. They cause problems, you have to do it. And the sooner you do it the easier it is to do.
    ID: 216.0 Positive: And the surest way to maintain that dignity and acquire it is through the union movement. And I’m with you. I promise you. Thank you for listening.
    ID: 105.0 Positive: And Barb, you talked about rebuilding. Well, you know what? Let’s get something straight here. Protesting is protesting, my buddy John Lewis used to say. But none of it justifies looting, burning or anything else. So regardless how angry you are, if you loot or you burn, you should be held accountable as someone who does anything else, period. It just cannot be tolerated across the board.
    ID: 603.0 Negative: No, but how can anybody believe it? He’s totally against, at his speech and at the DNC, where we got much higher numbers than they did, but they put out that they did, they’ll say anything. We got much higher by millions and millions of people. We had a great… Did we have a great convention? Right? We had a… Here’s my guy. Good job you did. But we had a great convention and it’s been a really terrific. I made a speech at Mount Rushmore and since that speech, our numbers have been up, up, up like a rocket, like a beautiful rocket, the Mount Rushmore speech. I said we’re getting hit by this pandemic very unfairly in the sense that we’ve done such a good job with the ventilators, all of the things, you’ve heard it a thousand times, and we have to get back. And I made a speech in really a great place, South Dakota, but it was Mount Rushmore. They want to blow it up. They want to take off my [inaudible 00:28:35]. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they’re the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down.
    ID: 997.0 Positive: They let her charge. And the people in the union didn’t want that. They didn’t want Hillary, they wanted Trump. And we had union revolts, we call them. They revolted. But these guys right here, are you all union people? I can tell. Are you union? It’s good, right? It’s fine. That’s fine. Look at that. You got a hand. Certain parts of the country, they wouldn’t be as happy, but that’s okay, right? And it’s great. But they were not happy. And you know what was happening? They were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the Democrats. American labor will vote for Trump Pence in 2020. They’re all saying that. And this area is going to be an incredible area. This used to be all Democrat until I came along. Until I came along, this was Democrat. This was heavily union. It was Democrat. It was everything.
    ID: 980.0 Positive: President Obama said when I sat down that first meeting, right? In the White House. He said it was the biggest problem we had. North Korea. And you would have had a big problem, would have been a hell of a war. Tell you right now. You’d probably be in that war right now. So when I say that we got along and we’ve met, everyone says, oh, that’s so terrible. No, it’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. Doesn’t mean bad things don’t happen, but it’s a good thing.
    ID: 109.0 Positive: Last piece, education. The idea in the United States of America, your education is determined by your zip code. Title one schools. You all know what a title one school is. Mostly in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, but also poor white neighborhoods where they can’t afford the tax base. Title one schools are unable to get $15 billion a year to make up for the $200 billion gap that exists between them and other school districts, white school districts. Well, guess what? We moved that to $45 billion a year. It means I can put every three, four and five year old in school. In school.
    ID: 75.0 Positive: I want to thank you all, for all you do. Don’t give up hope. Don’t give up hope. We can come back. We can come back stronger than we were before. I want to thank you all. I carry with me… I don’t have it. I gave it to my staff. I carry with me in my pocket… Do I have that around, anyone? Where’s my staff? I gave it away. Anyway, I carry a schedule in my pocket that lists every single day the number of troops lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. The number wounded. This is my schedule. The back of the schedule is always a black box. You can’t really see it. The press may be able to. It says daily US updates. Troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,922, not over 6,000, 6,922, is every one of those women and men left behind. An entire group of people relied on them.
    ID: 832.0 Positive: The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
    ID: 736.0 Positive: You add 35 to the people that have had it. And to all of the other things. People that have had it, where in theory, you can’t get it, although they found one person and they’re making a big deal. One person got it twice. But if you add it all up, it gives you very good protection.
    ID: 661.0 Positive: 5) Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It’ll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn’t that be nice? That would be nice. You know why? Not because of the electric. It’ll be nice because we want to save people. That’s why it’ll be nice. That’s the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we’re doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators.
    ID: 549.0 Positive: Joining us in the wonderful support effort of that mission is secretary of the interior, a man who’s worked so hard in this, David Bernhardt. Thank you very much, David. Thank you. And EPA administrator, very powerful, man. When he says you can do it, you do it when he says you can’t it’s over with, you don’t have a chance, Andrew Wheeler. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you. Great job. And of course your governor Ron DeSantis, who’s run, not only did he run a great campaign, he’s a great governor. Thanks Ron. What a great job. What a great job he did. Of course we’ll let you know on November 3rd, I’ll let you know if he did a good job, okay?
    ID: 594.0 Positive: And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That’s why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they’re all voting for me.
    ID: 610.0 Negative: It’s just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don’t, and we clean, and it’s very expensive to do that and they don’t, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it’s fuming up and we’re doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They are not working too good. Right? They want to ban straws, I said, well, I’ve had a couple of meals at McDonald’s, et cetera over the years, right? Wendy’s, a friend of mine owns Wendy’s, I’ll give it a plug, right? Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, “Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?” Oh, they’re okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it’s made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it’s that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It’s the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that don’t get it. Either that or people that just don’t like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he’ll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, “I want you to look in my eyes,” when he’s not wearing the mask because I’ve never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I’m all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you’re close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security.
    ID: 713.0 Positive: I know the suburbs, look … Westchester was ground zero, okay? For what they were trying to do. They were trying to destroy the suburban, beautiful place. The American dream, really. They wanted low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime. May not be nice to say, but I’ll say it. [crosstalk 00:02:18]
    ID: 435.0 Negative: I said to Schumer, “What do you think of the deal?” “I don’t like it because you got rid of the tariffs.” I said, “No, we left the tariffs on.” This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they’ll say, “It’s no good,” because they don’t love the country. They don’t love the country. Remember that. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That’s a nice plane. Somebody said to me, “Your plane’s just as nice as that.” I said, “No, it’s not. That’s Air Force One. That’s the nicest.” Always, that’s the nicest.
    ID: 319.0 Negative: A lot of people are dying. We’re up over 160,000 people dead so far. And I’ll end by saying that it goes back to the study some months ago by Columbia University saying that we didn’t have to be this way. If the president had acted sooner, just one week earlier, it would have saved 30-some-thousand lives. Two weeks earlier, I think it was 51,000 or 57,000 lives. I hope we’ve learned a lesson. Hope the president has learned a lesson, but again, this is not about Democrat, Republican or independent. It’s about saving America’s lives, so let’s Institute a mass mandate nationwide starting immediately, and we will save lives. The estimates are we’ll save over 40,000 lives in the next three months if that is done.
    ID: 345.0 Positive: One of the four planks of my Build Back Better plan is about addressing racial inequities across the entire economy. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest as you referenced, Arturo. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back and only get back to where they were at the beginning, which wasn’t a good place to begin with. We’re going to use every tool at our disposal to take on these inequities.
    ID: 1018.0 Negative: When Joe Biden was vice president, the border was an open pipeline for criminals, gang members and cartels, flooding our schools with drugs. Under my administration, we ended the catch and release, horrible catch and release. You catch the criminal. You take their name. You say, “Is this right?” “We don’t have identification.” “Oh, that’s okay.” It’s like voting. They don’t want to have voter ID. Why? There’s only one reason the Democrats don’t want voter ID. You have ID for almost everything. You have your picture, everything nice, but not on a vote. Most important thing you can do is to vote. And voter ID, but they don’t want it. There’s only one reason they don’t want voter ID. And you know what that is, right? That’s really better. You guys all in favor, by the way, of voter ID? Everybody? If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be congressmen in good standing for very long. I’ll tell you that.
    ID: 446.0 Positive: 1) So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, “I’ll call them back in a few days. I’m sorry, sir. He won’t be able to speak right now, he’ll call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.” On Tuesday, I announced that I’m doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, “Hey, how you doing? You called, I’m just returning your call.” “Oh, it’s too late, sir. We called about Israel. It’s too late.” I said, “Gee, I’m sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner.” I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we’re going to sign an agreement that hasn’t been signed in many decades. It’s peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done.
    ID: 283.0 Positive: Many people have heard me say this but I’ve always believed you can define America in one word, possibilities. The defining feature of America, everything is possible. That in America, everyone, and I mean, everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there’s only one way forward, as united America, a united America, united in our pursuit of a more perfect union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are you ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. We’re good and decent people. For Lord’s sake this is the United States of America, and there’s never been anything we’ve been able to accomplish when we’ve done it together.
    ID: 1131.0 Negative: They were all crying. He said, “Sir, you gave us back our life.” He said that. I had that just recently in Maine, they took away 5,000 square miles. Think of a square mile and then multiply it times 5,000. Took away 5,000 square miles. That was, O-Biden. As I call them, O-Biden. That was Obama and Biden short. I like that term. O-Biden, because you save a lot of time, but that was Obama and Biden in Maine took away 5,000, Mike, square miles. You know what that is? That’s like I said, “Let me see what it looks like on a map.” They basically took away the Atlantic ocean from Maine. And Maine is the greatest in the world for lobster and the greatest in the world, just about, for fishing. I said, “Why did he take this area?”
    ID: 906.0 Positive: Biden the other day said no he’d shut it down. He’d listen to some guy say and he’d shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There’s never been three months where we’ve put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we’re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we’re just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That’s why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we’re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won’t forget that.
    ID: 165.0 Positive: I’m sorry. Am I, over here? Okay.
    ID: 925.0 Positive: Who’s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don’t mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they’re not going to get them. So they’re going to complain and the election’s going to be over. And then they’re going to complain. And then they’ll say, “Oh, well, we didn’t get it. Big deal.” In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I’m talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they’re aggrieved. Like by saying this, we’re saying such a horrible thing. We’re not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we’re doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They’re doing very well. It’s very safe. It’s going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we’re all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good.
    ID: 631.0 Positive: Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we’ve been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don’t like ICE because ICE is, they’re tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don’t think so. Let’s see, you could probably be okay but you’d rather do what you’re doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what’s happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don’t even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they’ve done.
    ID: 520.0 Positive: Oh wait a minute, wait. It’s a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I’m lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That’s good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We’ve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that’s driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost –
    ID: 891.0 Positive: 7) We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect. We will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in, if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it is amazing how open they have been lately.
    ID: 140.0 Negative: But this year, we’re facing the most difficult circumstances and we’re seeing an awful lot of heart and a lot of grit from our educators, our students to try to rise to the occasion here, but our government hasn’t come up to that bar. They haven’t shown much grit at all or determination.
    ID: 658.0 Negative: 0) I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they’ve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they’d say it was one of the greatest jobs they’ve ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now they’re coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China.
    ID: 838.0 Positive: This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and has lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country.
    ID: 56.0 Negative: Big pharma lobbied Trump for a handout. That’s exactly what they got from him. US pharma is building factories overseas instead of the United States, skipping out on having to pay US taxes and then sending those same foreign made drugs back to American consumers, all while raising their prices on prescription drugs that union families and working people have to rely on. And in the process by the way, he’s trying to do away with all healthcare in America.
    ID: 1198.0 Negative: As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.
    ID: 912.0 Positive: So I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that’s been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn’t go there at all, they didn’t do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn’t do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you’re going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, “But we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations …” Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don’t think he’ll deny it, but he said, “According to the rules and regulations, the most people you’re allowed to have in that room,” meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, “Is 10 people.”
    ID: 745.0 Positive: Yeah.
    ID: 37.0 Positive: You don’t feel the same anxiety because you got a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, son, or a daughter who’s going through what you’re not, what we’re not. We have jobs. I don’t have a job now, but we have jobs. And so it’s a real concern. And I just think that this has moved beyond Democrat, Republican. I think it’s moved to trying to put this country back together again. So we can move.
    ID: 504.0 Positive: So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren’t working out too well, right? You can’t really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we’re rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We’re doing all mostly hangar things because we’re outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it’s very much different.
    ID: 702.0 Negative: I’ll tell you sometime, but it’s under investigation right now. But they came from a certain city, and this person was coming to the Republican National Convention. And there were like seven people on the plane like this person. And then a lot of people were on the plane to do big damage. They were coming [crosstalk 00:16:12]-
    ID: 593.0 Negative: Did you see this radical left? Mayor Wheeler, his name is. The radical left mayor. They chased him, Mike. They chased him out of his home last night. And all he does is be nice to them because they don’t understand nice. They only understand one thing: strength. They don’t understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them.
    ID: 404.0 Positive: And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. He’s a star. He’s going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. We’re now the party of the workers. We’re the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren’t really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, we’re the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, “he doesn’t act presidential”? And I used to say, “It’s so easy to be presidential.” I’d only have about 10 or 15 people here. You’d be bored. But remember I used to do that? But I’d always say, “I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat.” Tough to beat. That’s tough to beat, John James.
    ID: 342.0 Negative: On Monday, we marked the one year anniversary of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso, where a gunman explicitly sought to target Latinos and 23 beautiful lives were stolen from us and their families. I know what it’s like to lose a child. And I know what it was like to lose a wife. It is awful. It is starkly. I shouldn’t get started. You know, the stakes of Trump’s irresponsible policies of division and hate that he promotes is real. These are life and death decisions. Whether it’s repeated attacks on Dreamers or his campaign of terror against immigrant communities, whether it’s his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which is outrageous or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need. Donald Trump has failed the Latino community time and time again.
    ID: 33.0 Negative: Yes, I am. That’s why I try not to talk about it too much because I’m playing into. The more we talk about it … There’s two things he wants us to talk about, is the election legitimate? And the whole country is up in flames. Everything’s burning, law and order because he doesn’t want to talk about anything, anything at all about the job he hasn’t done. And so it’s a conundrum. There’s a lot we could talk about in terms of the specifics that Russia is doing and not doing it. But when you do, all it does is undermine what people think may be legitimate. What I don’t want to have happen, I don’t want people reaching the point where you can understand sometimes. It’s not worth voting.
    ID: 131.0 Negative: 7) That boy, after his convention, he really made inroads. He hasn’t, not at all. [inaudible 01:05:57] it should give you a little bit of, confidence in the American people, they ain’t buying it. With all the millions and millions and millions of dollars being spent, they’re not buying it. But we got to do more than them not buy it.
    ID: 312.0 Positive: Yep.
    ID: 841.0 Negative: In the Left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on Earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God.
    ID: 507.0 Positive: But what we’ve done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It’s exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. “Sir, we have to be able to see through.” I said, “All right, let’s go. Much more expensive.” I said, “Let’s go.” So we’re over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we’ve ever had by far and it’s a good time to have it too.
    ID: 858.0 Negative: China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude.
    ID: 156.0 Negative: I’m not going to speculate on what it means always, but I can say is that nothing this administration does is normal. And so I’m not being facetious when I say that. So who in God’s name knows what it was all about? I just don’t know. I don’t know. And I’m not going to speculate. I’ll let the experts do that. And so, and the only time that I have been on notice is when the president’s out of the country and I’m in the country, that not that I should wait for something to be immediately be aware of anything, but that’s something that might be called for. It wasn’t called for.
    ID: 270.0 Negative: 5 million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on earth. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in six, small businesses have closed this year. And this president, if he’s re-elected, you know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom and pop businesses will close their doors, and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by, and yet the wealthiest 1% will get tens of billions of dollars in new taxes breaks and the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until it’s destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people, including more than 15 million people on Medicaid, and getting rid of the protections that President Obama worked so hard to get passed for a hundred million more people who have preexisting conditions.
    ID: 641.0 Negative: 4) They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they’ve done this and they’ve been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She’s not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, “What about me?” He’s not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There’s not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control.
    ID: 961.0 Positive: And just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we’ll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn’t believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we’re going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I’ve heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They’re going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won’t be able to get built.
    ID: 142.0 Negative: Like many of you, because you’re all reporters, you also have a lot of friends and you have children, and you’re probably hearing the same thing I’m hearing throughout this pandemic. They’re struggling to figure out how to do the right thing, but they’re worried. They’re worried like the devil. “What does it mean for my kids? Is this setting my child’s education back beyond just a semester? What impact will it have? How’s my child going to catch up? What if I’m not doing enough to help my child succeed?” All those questions, the self-doubt that’s been engaged. President Trump may not think this a national emergency, but I think going back to school for millions of children and the impacts on their families and the community is a national emergency. I believe that’s what it is.
    ID: 201.0 Positive: You’re fighting for workers that aren’t even your members by a $15 minimum wage. Ban right to work laws and stop employers from misclassifying workers as contractors to avoid paying benefits. Give independent contractors and gig workers the right to organize and pass the Bush Lewis Act to protect every worker’s pension and make sure that sacred promise of a secure retirement is honored for everyone. So you don’t wake up one day like my dad did years and years ago, all of a sudden no pension. There’s a lot we can do, but I promise you we can get it done.
    ID: 794.0 Positive: I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now they’re all going to be coming in. Now they’re all saying, “How come you didn’t tell us about this?” You’ll have peace in the Middle East. And yet we’re moving our trips out. It’s pretty amazing, actually. We’ll get no credit for it, but that’s all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, we’ve spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. China’s entry. He’s done so many things. This man, if you look at what he’s done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal? Hillary Clinton’s deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right? 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didn’t come to us.
    ID: 830.0 Positive: Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen.
    ID: 428.0 Positive: I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you’ve been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how they’re all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, “I hope I haven’t insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen?” I stopped it. I stopped.
    ID: 966.0 Positive: And he said, “Sir, I don’t know. I can’t speak for anybody, but I’m from Tennessee and I’ve been doing this for a long time.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they’re coming from the cities. They’re coming from all over. I never say, they’re coming out of the rivers. They’re coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They’re coming from everywhere, sir. I’ve never seen anything like it.” But if other States are like Tennessee, you’re going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like it.” And people they’d be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It’s been an incredible experience for me. It’s been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I’ll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible… it’s going to be a great, great year.
    ID: 672.0 Positive: 2) From Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, from Erie to Easton, and from Bethlehem to right here in Arnold Palmer’s beloved Latrobe. I love Arnold Palmer. Arnold, where are you? We love Arnold. There was only one Arnold. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvania is the state where our founding fathers declared American Independence, right? Declared American Independence. Add the word Commonwealth in there. This way, they won’t [inaudible 01:35:24] us. It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything.
    ID: 697.0 Positive: We have them all.
    ID: 34.0 Positive: It seems to me that one of the things that I keep trying to say to people is, “Go to, Iwillvote.com.” Iwillvote.com and figure out where you can vote, how you can vote. What’s available to you, where you could vote early, where you could vote in person, where it’s going to be safe for you, et cetera. Plan now, plan now. But the more chaos that is sewn here, it’s going to disincline people to show up. And in a sense, every time I speak about it, I feel like I’m playing into his game. Not do you agree with me, but does that make sense what I’m saying? So I think that’s all part of the deal.
    ID: 764.0 Negative: It’s his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. You’re not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn’t want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we’re used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. It’s true.
    ID: 833.0 Positive: In the new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach four new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.
    ID: 944.0 Positive: The next president. This is so important. This is so… Whether you’re talking about life, whether you’re talking about second amendment, whether you’re talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, “I want to thank you for defeating ISIS.” I said, “Now, are you talking about me or the United States?” “You, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.” I said, “Good. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?” And he said, “I will.” So let’s say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country.
    ID: 1216.0 Positive: That didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was-
    ID: 333.0 Positive: The question is for all Americans to answer, who are we as a nation? What do we stand for? And most importantly, what do we want to be? Someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there’s nothing Americans cannot achieve what we put our minds to it and we do it together.
    ID: 114.0 Positive: [inaudible 00:42:18] bragging about you.
    ID: 10.0 Negative: What may be just as shocking is many other jobs have also become dangerous due to COVID. Being a healthcare worker is now more dangerous than ever. We’ve lost hundreds of them this year because they weren’t protected from COVID on the job. Being a meat packer is more dangerous than ever. So many have died due to getting COVID at work. Work for waitresses and waiters and transit workers all have become more dangerous, with so many dying of COVID. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter what he says or what he claims, you are not safer in Donald Trump’s America. You’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America where people are dying at a rate last seen when Americans were fighting in World War II. Donald Trump’s malpractice during this pandemic has made being a working American a life or death work. And while there is a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino, and Asian Americans and Native Americans working class communities, white working class communities are being hit hard as well.
    ID: 539.0 Positive: 3) … And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state’s tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn’t build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we’ll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you’re going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You’re not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down.
    ID: 699.0 Negative: Biden won’t calm things down. They will take over. They will have won. If Biden gets in, they will have won. He’s a weak person. He’s controlled like a puppet. So it’s not going to be calm things down. It’s going to be, they will have won. They will have taken over your cities. It’s a revolution. You understand that, it’s a revolution. And the people of this country will not stand for that. They’re not going to stand for that. The vast majority of people feel like me. They feel like… Every time I put law and order up on social media, it gets such an incredible positive response. The people of this country will not stand for it. If you say calm things down. Yeah. Calm things down, because they will have taken over. Take a look at what’s going on. And Biden… Well, Biden is, I don’t even like to mention Biden, because he’s not controlling anything.
    ID: 973.0 Negative: Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don’t understand, and probably when it happened, they’d say, what did we ever do? Joe Biden has pledged to hike your taxes by $4 trillion in the largest tax hike in history. And they’re going to waste the money on the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal. You know what you get out of that? Nothing. Nothing except debt and death. They want to eviscerate the Second Amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your guns. Well, you remember that, just that one point alone, and they want to take away your guns. So who’s going to vote for that? I mean, we want our Second Amendment. I’ve held it strong, and you think it was easy? I’ve held it totally strong.
    ID: 914.0 Positive: I have to tell you, we’re going to do a lot of things. I’m just going to go over very briefly because we’re going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you’re all going to be listening. Because I came in, I’m on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They’ve got them in closets, they’ve got them on ceilings, floors. They’ve got more … You can’t escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn’t have this. They weren’t having it, can you believe it? They didn’t have it. No no, CNN didn’t have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It’s a I wouldn’t say fully owned corporation but it’s certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who’s controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it’s very interesting –
    ID: 259.0 Negative: And instead of telling Vladimir Putin that there’d be no putting up with this, that there’d be a heavy price to pay if they dare touch an American soldier, this president doesn’t even bring up the subject in his multiple phone calls with Putin. It’s been reported that Russian forces just attacked American troops in Syria, injuring our service members. Did you hear the president say a single word? Did he lift one finger? Never before has an American president played such a subservient role to a Russian leader. It’s not only dangerous, it’s humiliating and embarrassing for the rest of the world to see, it weakens us. Not even American troops can feel safer under Trump. Donald Trump’s role as a bystander in his own presidency extends to the economic plan and pain. The plan he doesn’t have and the pain being felt by millions of Americans. He said this week, and I quote, “You better vote for me, or you’re going to have the greatest depression you’ve ever seen.” Does he not understand and see the tens of millions of people who’ve had to file for unemployment this year so far?
    ID: 1072.0 Positive: And I’ll never let you down, sheriffs. I’ll never let you down. You know that. We gave you all of the surplus equipment. We had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and Obama and Biden didn’t want to give it. They didn’t want to give it. They thought it looked too militaristic, meaning it was … A lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe. And I distributed it. All of hundreds of millions of dollars. It was sitting there drawing dust and warehouses that we were probably paying a fortune for all over the country, and you got it. We all got it. Everybody got it. And everybody’s happy.
    ID: 118.0 Positive: Well, I think, Alderman, what’s been unleashed with a lot of people is they understand that fear doesn’t solve problems. Only hope does. And if you give up hope, you might as well surrender. There’s no real option. And as we talked, I listened to his mom. She was on the phone. She wasn’t with Jacob, she was in the same location. And as I said, his dad, his son, his brother, two sisters, and a family lawyer, two family lawyers were there. And what I came away with was the overwhelming sense of resilience and optimism that they have about the kind of response they’re getting. His mom talked about, we asked, my wife asked to say a prayer. And his mom said a prayer. She said, “I’m praying for Jacob, but I’m praying for the policemen as well. I’m praying that things change.”
    ID: 1093.0 Positive: We’re going to win. My administration by contrast is following the science, applying common sense, mitigation, sheltering, you know this, we got a shelter. We got to take care. But what do we really have to do? We have to take care of our elderly people, our elderly people with heart problems, with diabetes, and we’re launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine and therapeutics. More than 270 therapies are in clinical trials. Can you believe it? 270. And you’re going to be hearing some very good news very, very soon.
    ID: 618.0 Positive: Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He’s a great doctor. I said, “No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time.” So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who’s a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, “The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,” I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it…? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It’s essentially the same thing. I don’t want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that? You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, “How could that be?” So remember, this is the same visit, same visit.
    ID: 54.0 Negative: He invited companies to the White House to make what he called the pledge to American workers. He couldn’t even keep those firms from outsourcing. Many were given lucrative federal contracts, but then some of them turned around and shipped 7,000 jobs overseas. Under President Trump, US trade deficit has grown. It’s hit an all time high. Let me say that again. US trade deficit is at an all time high under Trump in the last three years.
    ID: 614.0 Negative: But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was he’s very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don’t remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden’s physical level. They view me as being somebody that’s, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let’s go here, let’s go there, let’s go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I’ve answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn’t answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I’ve never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, “Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, I’m sorry to bother you with this question.” It’s the most incredible.
    ID: 741.0 Negative: Well, I always tell her to go back to San Francisco, take care of your homeless problem. Take care of your problem in California. Because there’s nothing like what I’m witnessing out there. Right outside, right where she lives right in her district is so bad. Needles all over the place-
    ID: 956.0 Positive: So we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts.
    ID: 1104.0 Positive: We replaced probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new USMCA, which puts us right at the top. And now Canada and Mexico are doing what’s right for our country. It’s been a great deal. And when the Wisconsin timber industry was being threatened by administration, took immediate action. We imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving countless timber jobs all across your state, and you know exactly what I’m talking about. You were taken advantage of by stupid US policy. Canada was taking advantage of this country. Not anymore. If Biden and the crew get in, the radical left will bring timber production to a total halt. I stood up to China’s decades of trading abuses. And when China targeted our farmers, we provided $28 billion in relief, we gave our farmers. I said to Secretary Perdue, secretary of agriculture, “Sonny, how much they’ve targeted our farmers. How much have they been targeted for? ” Sir, two years ago it was 12 billion, last year it was 16 billion, 28 billion total.” I said, “Guess what? We’re charging tariffs of $28 billion to China.” We charged so much more and we gave 12 billion, and 16 and 28. We gave … any farmers in here, any farmers? Did I do a good job for you, please? I don’t hear any farmers complaining. Am I right? We did a good job.
    ID: 1239.0 Positive: But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you.
    ID: 948.0 Negative: And I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we’ve done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don’t even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they’ve taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can’t do it. I love solar. It’s all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that’s okay, except we don’t have them. And it’s not going to power these massive factories.
    ID: 1028.0 Positive: I recognized Israel’s true capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and recognized Israel and its sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else. They talked about it for years. For years and years, many, many presidents talked about the capital of Israel, Jerusalem. And they never did it. I did it. And Golan Heights, 52 years, they’ve been meeting on Golan Heights. I did it. Last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the Middle East, finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can-
    ID: 44.0 Positive: Look, earlier this week and the reason we’re a little bit late here, we found as I was getting off the plane, the press asked me a legitimate question that I did not have the background on because it occurred on the plane. Earlier this week, we celebrated Labor Day. And here in the heart of the American automobile industry, we never forget everything that we owe the unions. And unions, as you’ve heard me say many times, built this country. Unions built the economy. The economic engine has driven American manufacturing dynamism. And literally in the case of the auto workers, you’re the ones that did it.
    ID: 335.0 Positive: When I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions, as I’ve asked Kamala, but the most important was he asked me, what I wanted most importantly. I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions. That’s what I asked Kamala, I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people. I got a chance to spend some time at my home today with Kamala and Doug, and I want to thank them. I thanked them then, but thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with Jill and me. Doug, you’re going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you’re about to take on, America’s first Second Gentlemen. And although they’re not with us here today, I want to thank Ella and Cole as well.
    ID: 609.0 Negative: Check out all of the statements he’s made on everything and now he’s going the opposite way, but he’s agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he’ll do that. And then he figures later on, he’ll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what’s happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it’s been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn’t a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what’s happened. And this is really what’s happened. If you’re not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save.
    ID: 272.0 Negative: As president the first step I will take would be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives because I understand something this president hasn’t from the beginning, we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, we’ll never have our lives back until we deal with this virus. The tragedy of where we are today is it didn’t have to be this bad. Just look around. It’s not this bad in Canada, or Europe, or Japan, or almost anywhere else in the world. And the president keeps telling us, the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him. No miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases, we lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian-American, Native American communities bearing the brunt of it. And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan.
    ID: 1094.0 Negative: Now, we’re dealing with the deep state. So I’m watching it very closely. I don’t need to have them announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found the vaccine, it’s perfect.” I don’t need that. And hopefully everyone’s looking to do the right thing. We want to get it out quickly, but we’re very close, both on therapy and on therapeutics and on vaccines. Advances in treatment have reduced the fatality rate in adults by 85% since April. Think of that. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we’re mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we’re going to have it out very quickly. We will defeat the China virus. We will have the greatest economy that we’ve ever had next year, unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they’re talking about, we will have next year, the single greatest economy we’ve ever had. So Biden’s been there for 47 years and he’s personally supported every globalist sellout of the last half century. He voted for NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals in history. For the China entry into the World Trade Organization, a total catastrophe. For Korea, the Korean deal was horrible. We renegotiated it. Now it’s a really great deal for us. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight. Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business. It would have been a disaster for our country. I ended it, but I approved the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately. The Keystone Pipeline, 48,000 jobs.
    ID: 960.0 Positive: They’re almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected… and you don’t hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It’s very important. You won’t hear that. You won’t hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I’m going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night?
    ID: 1200.0 Positive: Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it.
    ID: 175.0 Positive: Well, I say that I understand their concern, because so many of the teachers also have other preexisting conditions that lend itself to the fact that if they were to contract the COVID disease, COVID-19, that they would be very susceptible to be in real trouble. It’s understandable why they’re doing it. But the first thing to do, is make sure that all the protective capacity that we have available to us is made available. And then-
    ID: 1114.0 Positive: Well, thank you very much, Minnesota. There was supposed to only have like a hundred people. You know, we’re supposed to have these tiny little crowds. You can’t have any more than that. It’s very heavily restricted. That’s a lot of people showed up. I want to thank you. We’d love to have those rallies, but I guess you just can’t do that. And you’re not allowed to do that now. So we don’t do that, but we do the little airport hops and people like them and a lot of people come back. But unfortunately we had to hold off a lot of people in the back, which I feel badly about. In 78 days, we’re going to be. 78 days. We’re going to win this state. We’re going to take back the White House and we’re going to have an election that’s all about the survival, our nation.
    ID: 1077.0 Negative: We’re going to play, I don’t know, guess we’ll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California. They like me. And we’ll do a tiny little shot in Illinois. The other one we’re going to do, we’re going to go after New Jersey, we’re going to go after Virginia. We have a crazy governor of Virginia. He doesn’t want you to have guns and he doesn’t mind not only abortion, he doesn’t mind execution, because after birth, we’ll decide what to do with the baby, right? No, no. After. You hear this guy? First time I had heard of it. Scott, after birth, we will decide and we will discuss with the mother. And that’s the first time I’ve heard of it. This is the guy that likes to pretend he’s Michael Jackson, right? With the dancing. His wife saved a great embarrassment.
    ID: 12.0 Negative: Second and similarly, the economic pain remains unrelenting for millions of working people of every race and background aren’t getting relief they need. Meanwhile, wealthy are doing just fine, some better than ever. This divergence in fortunes is unique to any recession in recent memory. And the painful truth is we just have a president who just doesn’t see it. He doesn’t feel it. He doesn’t understand. He just doesn’t care. He thinks if the stock market is up, then everything’s fine. If his wealthy friends and donors are doing well, then everything’s doing well. If corporations see their valuations rising, then they must be hiring. But the best economists know what I know. I have learned growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware up the road, places where folks aren’t invested in the market like wealthy Americans. A measure of our economic success is the quality of life of the American people.
    ID: 160.0 Positive: And so we’ve worked out a protocol where, how I get in the plane, what kind of plane I get on, how it’s sanitized, how I engage people. It’s like when I’m engaging all of you everywhere I go. It’s always at a safe distance and everybody’s wearing masks. And the vast majority of people that I’m meeting with have been, had come into my home and staff and the like, they’re all tested as well. So I’m just trying to set the example, wearing the protective gear, the mask, which I have with me. I’m able at this distance to take it off, number one. Number two, making sure that we proceed in a way with adequate social distancing and do it the right way.
    ID: 1130.0 Positive: He’s not going to be one of them that get elected and then he walks into those gorgeous buildings when they had those big, beautiful dollar bills and they built marble columns. And it’s so beautiful. And so rich, he’s not going to say, “Darling, we finally arrived. Now we can go with majority.” He’s going to do what’s right. He’s going to do what’s right. I know Jason, you need Jason, get Jason elected please. But they closed it up. And I was here and a worker. I was making speeches before you had to stand 200 feet away from everybody, before you had to stand like two football fields away. And a worker came up to me with a group of his friends and they were all crying and they were tough. They never cried before in their life. Maybe when they were babies but I doubt it.
    ID: 20.0 Negative: Well, I wear [inaudible 00:38:24] is a big issue, I’m a smart fellow, I listen to scientists, this is not a game, life and death. Reports that we’re going to have maybe… There’s some reports that say another 100,000 dead, as many as a 100,000 dead, more by the end of the year. I mean, I don’t get it. I mean, I just… Anyway, it’s hard to respond to something so idiotic.
    ID: 1129.0 Positive: How smart is China? Right? The biggest corn order. Think. They said the biggest corn order in history. So I have to say, “Ah.” But I tell you, my view has changed a lot. We’ve made a great deal with China, but my view has changed a lot. USMCA is the biggest deal ever made. And that one is working out great between Canada and Mexico. And remember this, Minnesota, under the last administration, the last administration, Minnesota iron range was wiped out. Seven plants were idled and more than 2,000 workers were laid off. Obama and Biden closed it down. Do you remember that? The finest iron ore in the world, they say, I don’t know, what do I know? To me it all looks the same, but they say it’s the finest iron ore in the world. That’s good enough for me. And what did I do? Almost immediately after getting into office, I heard about this disaster, just like Keystone Pipeline, just like so much else, Jason. And you’ll be working on that with me and in the beautiful halls of the Senate. And he’s going to stay with us. He’s not going to be one of those that gets elected.
    ID: 1091.0 Negative: And Biden has promised to slash our defense budget, destroying critical jobs. But more importantly, if we don’t have defense, everything we talk about is meaningless. We have to have defense. Defense of our country, especially when you look at what’s happening outside of our borders. So we have the greatest, right now when I took it over was totally depleted. It was gone. Right now, we have the greatest military we’ve ever had, the greatest equipment by far we’ve ever had. If Kamala and Biden are ever elected, this recovery will come to a total shutdown to use their word permanently. For no scientific reason. Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy, locking everyone in their homes.
    ID: 703.0 Positive: Yeah, this is all happening.
    ID: 522.0 Negative: No, but it was a terrible thing. You’d pass away and your kids would get the farm, they’d go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They’d put big mortgages on the farm, they’d lose the farm, they’d lose the business. You don’t have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he’s changed. He’s changed. “After 47 years I’ve changed. I swear to you I’ve changed.” Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that’s okay. He was better against Bernie. Something’s going on there, I don’t know. You know what I’m talking about. But he was better against Bernie.
    ID: 184.0 Positive: Let me tell you something. Folks have figured out, it’s not the financial wizards of Wall Street that made this country run, or make it run. It’s you, America’s essential workers. You’re the folks breaking your necks, risking your lives, keeping the country going, in our hospitals, on our streets, in our schools. I’ve said it time and again, and I’ll say it again and again, Wall Street did not build this country. You did, the great American middle class, and the middle class was built by unions. Unions. The American people now finally get it, after a long time of being convinced that unions were a problem, not the answer.
    ID: 352.0 Positive: The idea is you wait outside the 10 o’clock mass to grab someone from church. The anxiety for the children, the anxiety is overwhelming. It’s going to have a profound impact on a generation. We’re going to protect Dreamers and their families, and every single agreement that the Trump administration signed to turn local law enforcement and immigration officials. On day one, I’m going to send Congress a bill for immigration reform. We’ll focus on keeping families together. It’s about families, including providing a clear roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented alien and undocumented immigrants. Stop treating them the way they’re being treated. We’re going to live in enriching our communities every single day.
    ID: 917.0 Positive: Just like with energy, they don’t want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it.
    ID: 1155.0 Positive: I have a very different vision for America’s future, you got to see it before the plague, but you’re seeing it again right now, even more so. It starts with creating 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and that’s what’s happening. Over the next four years, we will cut even more taxes, substantially, and regulations. That’s why people are pouring into our country to open up factories, they’re bringing them back to Minnesota and every place else. In Michigan, we have auto plants opening up left and right, and expanding. They haven’t seen that in 42 years. We will end our reliance on China. We will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States.
    ID: 108.0 Positive: There’s a lot more to say, but I probably already said too much, except that there’s a lot we’re able to do. The public is ready to do these things. I promise you. I promise you.
    ID: 821.0 Negative: 9) We’re returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we don’t take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we? They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, “Well, we didn’t mean that.” Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, “That’s right.” You don’t know what it is, what happened? What happened? They did it on purpose. They did it twice. That’s where they’re coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that’s where they’re coming from. So don’t be surprised, but they’re not going to get there. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs.
    ID: 302.0 Positive: I think I heard you say somewhere along line what I’ve been saying, this cell phone has changed America. Because what happens now? We’re at a point where some brave kid, 15 years old can stand there, and for a total of eight minutes and 46 seconds take a photograph of a black man whose family I know and met with, and understand, and spent time with, and watched him brutally murdered, brutally murdered. And people around the world were saying, “My God.” … That it really happens, because I’m not in a neighborhood like that. I don’t come from a place. And now guess what? They’re demanding change.
    ID: 962.0 Positive: So they’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we’re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know it very quickly. We’re not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they’re not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to [inaudible 00:03:44]. Let’s spend 37 million to… look, we’ve got to be smart. Got to be smart. We’ve got to win an election. Also, we’re going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States.
    ID: 392.0 Negative: I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it’s not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, they’ve tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day.
    ID: 1169.0 Negative: You know that, criminals are terrorizing civilians in Chicago, Portland, and now New York City. This radical left Mayor de Blasio has let our beautiful diamond, I loved it, I left it four years ago. I could see there were the seeds of problems. He was there, but I left and it was wonderful. Four years ago I left it, and over the last year, especially over the last six months, crime has gone up hundreds of percentage points, hundreds. 273 points, 368 points. Numbers that you wouldn’t believe. And we’re talking about shootings, murders, you saw what happened this weekend. You saw that, Jason. Terrible. My city, I love that city, but it has great potential and we’re going to do something. We’re going to do something strong. They just let it go to hell and I don’t know is it because they’re bad people or they have no common sense, or they just don’t know what they’re doing? But our beautiful diamond, of this country, has been let go to hell.
    ID: 1113.0 Positive: We’re going to be proud of it again. It lost $78 billion in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years, $78 billion. We want to make our post office strong. We want to be proud of it. I want to thank you very much. You’ve been my friends, my true friends. We will win and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
    ID: 976.0 Negative: Close down charter schools. Eliminate school choice. So important. Abolish the suburbs. They want to put low-income housing in the suburbs. So the American dream … And by the way, we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, all did phenomenally last year with jobs. Best jobs we’ve ever had in the history of our country, the best economy we’ve ever had. But they’re a big part of the suburbs. And they want to put low income housing in the suburbs at a level that they’ve never done it before. And it’s been a very … Look, this has been going on for 20 years. I terminated the regulation that did that. They said, “Well, we can change that.” I said, “No, let’s terminate it.” People have to aspire to go there. They want to aspire to live in the suburbs.
    ID: 518.0 Negative: The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O’Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don’t like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don’t like it. I look at these crowds and if they’re going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they’re going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We’re going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we’re going to win Florida.
    ID: 372.0 Positive: Now, we’re building it again and it’s being built fast. By the way, it’s turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now it’s starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that’s what it’s about. If we win, America wins.
    ID: 379.0 Positive: Let’s ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, we’re rounding the turn. You see what’s happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good we’re doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn’t like saying that. They don’t like telling you that.
    ID: 1027.0 Positive: I want to get that mosquito out of here. I don’t like … They’ll say it’s cruelty to animals. I don’t know. No, it’s true. They were saying the other night, the shark. They were saying, “Oh, sharks. We have to protect them.” I said, “Wait a minute. Wait.” They actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark. I said, “Wait, don’t you have it the other way around?” That’s true. I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes am I going to lose? I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark. It’s called Save the Shark.” I say, “No thank you. I have other things I can contribute to.”
    ID: 974.0 Negative: Give free healthcare to illegal aliens. You don’t get free healthcare? Expand deadly sanctuary cities. Force taxpayers to subsidize late-term abortion. Shut down the energy fields of Pennsylvania. They want to shut them down. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuel. Texas isn’t too happy, either. Go to Texas. I just left Texas a little while ago, two weeks. I said, they don’t want energy, they don’t want guns, and they don’t want religion. A guy stands up, says, “Not going to win Texas!” But you have the same thing, because you do a big, you’re a big fracking state. You want to see your taxes go up? Stop fracking. Doesn’t hurt you at all, fracking. They want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses. Put up a big windmill. You walk out your door. You’ll see those big monsters churning. But even that they don’t want to do. I don’t think they want to do anything. I think they want to close your businesses.
    ID: 456.0 Positive: 2) Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You don’t hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” That’s it. We’re doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, “Keep calm and carry on.” That’s what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, “Well, Trump knew a little bit.” They wanted me to come out and scream, “People are dying, we’re dying.” No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We don’t want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead.
    ID: 193.0 Positive: I’ll tell you something, my Beau wasn’t a loser or a sucker. He spent six months in Kosovo as Assistant US Attorney, trying to make sure that they had a criminal justice system. He’s the only foreigner has a 12-foot statue erected to him, a memorial to him because of what he did in Kosovo. Then he volunteered. He was Attorney General and he had to get special permission to volunteer to go with his unit to Iraq for one solid year. Won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service medal, and other awards. He didn’t serve with losers and suckers. He served with heroes. He served with American patriots.
    ID: 675.0 Positive: Thank you.
    ID: 576.0 Negative: And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we’ve done a great job on it. We don’t get the credit. We don’t get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I’ll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That’s what we’re doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people.
    ID: 244.0 Positive: We are. I’m really excited you’re willing to do this with me.
    ID: 1118.0 Positive: I want to thank your terrific representatives in Congress, Tom Emmer. Where’s Tom? Tom, Tom, Tom.
    ID: 168.0 Positive: That’s why focusing on daycare centers and making sure they’re safe and healthy now ,is equally as important as dealing with, almost as equally important as dealing with schools. We should be providing all of the PPE and all of the safety that is necessary in sanitary capacity, to allow them to open. Hundreds of them have been opening, because some states have gone in and done that. There should be universal guidance coming from the President of United States of America. There should be basic standards to how, in fact, and what circumstances you can safely open a daycare center, you can safely open a childcare center.
    ID: 1140.0 Negative: One of the biggest differences between this year and four years ago is FOX. FOX is like from a different planet, and too bad. And you know what’s going to happen? If we don’t win, they’re going to go down the tubes along with every other media outlet, they’ll all be bust, they’ll all be gone, I can tell you that. Nobody’s going to want to cover Sleepy Joe. We’ll end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell, but when you look at it and when you look at what’s happening, that’s why we have to win this election, and if we don’t win this election, every one of you, me, all of us, it will never be the country … I don’t think the country can ever come back to it.
    ID: 807.0 Positive: 9) Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market? And hopefully we’re at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now? Record levels.
    ID: 474.0 Positive: Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it’s not only is it a V, it’s a super V. You see what’s happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It’s down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we’re opening it up and your state should go with it. We’re opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It’s going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we’re going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over.
    ID: 535.0 Positive: If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won’t take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn’t even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don’t know that because the fake news doesn’t want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we’re going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that’s incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.
    ID: 998.0 Negative: But they liked Trump and I’m going to never let you down and they will let you down. They will let you down. First of all, the country will be let down because the country, you will see a crash like you’ve never seen before. And as good as those stock market numbers are, there’s a headwind. They headwind is that if he won, the market’s going to crash. The Green New Deal, all of the different things, socialized medicine, that’s what they want. It’s socialized medicine. No doctor, no plan. Obama lied about it 28 times. Do you remember he said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” It wasn’t true. 28 different times, they have them. For the last four years, we’ve been reversing Biden’s betrayals and delivering historic wins. For the people of Pennsylvania, your state lost over 50,000 manufacturing jobs when Biden was vice president. In my first three years, Pennsylvania gained 14, 000 jobs, manufacturing, and going up at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ll catch all of those jobs that were lost.
    ID: 1217.0 Negative: Incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various … Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out.
    ID: 452.0 Negative: 6) We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home, and they’re coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know? Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I’ve ever seen. But he said, “Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong.” He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis.
    ID: 280.0 Positive: She was a great second lady and I know she’ll make a great first lady for this nation. She loves this country so much. And I’ll always have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley, all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister, they give me courage, they lift me up. While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform, a year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi war veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief. I’ll be a president who’ll stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries, the days of cozying up to dictators is over. Under President Biden, america will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on their heads of American soldiers, nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting. And I’ll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity.
    ID: 903.0 Negative: Because we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let’s see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they’re trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they’re working on, sending them out to people that didn’t ask for them, they didn’t ask, they just get them and it’s not fair and it’s not right and it’s not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It’s just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they’re trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They’ll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most … For a long period of time, I would say, “Well 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great …” That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win.
    ID: 1122.0 Positive: We are going to win the House. I’m very much involved in every single race and with the Senate, we’re working very hard. I think we’re going to be in great shape in the Senate. And I think we’re a great, did you see that CNN, they raised us 10 points in one poll that took place over a short period of time? And it’s still not good enough. It’s still not good enough. You mean they’re getting more honest because I’ll tell you what, there’s never been enthusiasm like we have. There’s never been. Right, Tom? Including in 2016, we’ve never had. We had more enthusiasm than anyone’s seen maybe ever in a presidential campaign and it pales in comparison to what’s going on right now. It does.
    ID: 359.0 Positive: Just last year, 29 states, 29 states introduced or carried over bills that tried to make it harder for people to vote. This blatantly Unamerican. Our democracy, one person, one vote. That’s the very heart of who we are. And if the Senate, Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, don’t take up the bill, newly renamed in honor of my friend John Lewis to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full power, I will make it a priority on day one that we do that if I’m elected president.
    ID: 952.0 Positive: I don’t think so. You’re not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare’s horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We’ve protected your second amendment. So important. We’re protected the second amendment. We’ve cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I’m really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They’re taking ads on me. I said… I went to Mark Meadows. I said, “Mark, they’re killing me.” They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There’s nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, “Well look, if you’re not going to negotiate a fair deal, we’re going to do a favored nations clause.” To the top people, the biggest guys.
    ID: 779.0 Positive: With the help of everyone here today, we’ve accomplished more in the first three years. We’ve done so much. We’ve done so much. You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we’ve done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, I’ve watched politicians. Don’t forget, I’ve only been doing this for four and a half years. I haven’t been to … I’ve had senators come in. I’ve had congressmen come in. “Sir, I’ve been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I’ve only lost three races, sir.” I said, “But I’ve only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president.” It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn’t need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it? Uh-oh. Don’t raise that … Oh she is? Is she okay? I’ll get it for her. Is she okay? We got to get her on the list. Tell me. Oh, from before. Well, that’s a long time before I was president. Does she want to get on the list? Because I’ve seen you at rallies before. I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list. It’s called right to try. Right to try. Good work.
    ID: 629.0 Negative: We’re reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They’re considered a developing nation, you see I’ve been sort of protesting that like, but they’re considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They’re not a developing nation, they’re a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That’s all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America.
    ID: 167.0 Positive: Help is on the way. I’ve laid out a clear plan for childcare, a clear plan for starting early education as well, so three and four and five year olds are in school. But I’m not President right now. What we should be doing, is we should be providing for more help for people who in fact, are trying to juggle the choice between, do I stay home with my three, four or five-year old and take care of them in the middle of this COVID problem? Or, do I go to work and earn a salary? What do I do? That’s why we have, I have a major initiative to deal with childcare and eldercare, so people can be adequately paid to come and take care of folks, children, as well as the elderly that you may be taking care of a parent, a husband and wife may be taking care of, as well as making sure that those folks are able to get back to work.
    ID: 517.0 Positive: Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I’ll tell you he’ll be a great governor. He loves your state, he’ll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you’re going to do well, Dan. I know you’re really getting up there, it’s getting very close. I’ll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you’re allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you’re not supposed to have political rallies. I said, “You know the money that your state is going to be losing?” But if this guy doesn’t open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn’t open up your state, you have no choice, you’re going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you’ll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote.
    ID: 514.0 Positive: You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, “That’s a big number, right?” I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they’re only lying if it’s us because they don’t want to be bothered. In other words they’re not lying about Sleepy Joe, they’re lying about us, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to love that or hate it, I don’t know if it’s an insult or not but I will take it. We don’t give a damn. If that’s the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it.
    ID: 638.0 Negative: 8) Together we’ve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, ” This will be 250,000,” and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it’s a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, “That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible thing.” Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn’t believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add.
    ID: 323.0 Positive: Hello hello. Thanks for being here. I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we’re keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. Good afternoon everyone. To me and to Kamala, this is an exciting day. It’s a great day for our campaign and it’s a great day for America in my view. Over the past several weeks I have had the incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders, all of whom are qualified to be president. With each one, the more I learned about them, the more I talked to them, the more impressed I was even though I knew them before. I want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process and I look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected God willing.
    ID: 669.0 Positive: 6) But now it’s going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation’s clause. I see the drug companies are, they’re killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. They’re spending because they can’t believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. That’s what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so we’re paying $2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 25 cent price. So, what’s going to happen that’ll go up. Ours will come way down.
    ID: 1105.0 Positive: I’ll tell you what, with a more typical president … I want to be nice, more typical, every farmer would be out of business right now, but we gave 28 billion to the farmers think of that. And the farmers are doing well. And then we signed a deal with China. And I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi. We signed a great deal. And under the deal, they would buy $240 billion, 50 billion of farm product and then manufacturing. Once the China flu came in, once the China stuff came in, I was not … really, I wasn’t, I couldn’t, it was different. But I have to tell you, four days ago, the corn order was the largest corn order in the history of ordering corn.
    ID: 213.0 Positive: I’m not unique in this regard. My brothers and sisters aren’t either. I remember him coming up the stairs saying, honey, we can’t live in this apartment anymore. We’re going to, and you can’t go to school. You can’t play on that little league team. You’re going to go home and live with grandpa. And it must’ve been hard for my dad to walk into my grandpop’s pantry, a man with four sons and lost one in World War II and a daughter and saying, Ambrose, can I leave the kids with you? It’s only going to be, take me about a year, but I’ll come home every weekend.
    ID: 269.0 Positive: So the question for us is simple. Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be. All elections are important but we know in our bones, this one is more consequential. As many have said, America’s at an inflection point, a time of real peril, but also of extraordinary possibilities. We can choose a path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion, or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite, a path of hope and light. This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time. Character is on the ballot, compassion is on the ballot, decency, science, democracy, they’re all on the ballot. Who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and most importantly, who we want to be, that’s all on the ballot. And the choice could not be more clear. No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this president on the facts.
    ID: 766.0 Negative: They’re not protestors. Those aren’t … Those are anarchists. They’re agitators. They’re rioters. They’re looters. They’re not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, “Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right?” Friendly …
    ID: 189.0 Positive: I’m going to hold company executives personally liable for interfering with workers who are attempting to unionize. It’s not enough just to have their corporations pay a fine. If they’re part of the problem, they are going to pay a personal price. We’re going to have a National Labor Relations Board that actually wears striped shirts, is fair, that actually defends workers’ rights. If you go back to the 1930s, the purpose of the NLRB, what it states, it doesn’t say Americans must merely allow unions to exist. That’s what corporations try to tell you. What the act explicitly says is that the government should encourage unionization. Encourage.
    ID: 951.0 Positive: So they don’t want anything. Now, they’re getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn’t happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It’s no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don’t think you’re going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you’re not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don’t think so.
    ID: 763.0 Negative: This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden.
    ID: 1157.0 Positive: But the favored nations clause could reduce drugs by 50, 60, 70, even 80%. Think of that one. And I’m the only president in 51 years, that had a year, last year, where drug prices came down, but that was peanut stuff compared to what I’m talking about. So when you see those ads, if you don’t mind, and you see the drug companies hitting me, you’ll say, “Thank you, President Trump for reducing drug prices.” I guarantee you, if they were going up, they wouldn’t be taking ads. It makes sense, I guess, right? I hope people understand that, because they are spending a lot of money. They don’t like me. I did something that was unthinkable.
    ID: 25.0 Positive: She’s been on the road, she’s out herself. The role is that, just like when Barack and I campaigned, we try to cover as much territory as we could, and both of us out campaigning. She is an incredibly competent candidate, she is doing a great job. There will be times where together, but there’s a lot of territory to cover. I talk with her almost every day, I speak with her, we work together, and I have great confidence in her. There’s nothing about not campaigning together, it’s about being able to cover more territory.
    ID: 27.0 Positive: Well, what they’re doing is they’re going to do it on a regular basis because everyone on my service detail and people who come into the house with me, they’re all tested. I just, “Yes, sir.” Show up and put my head back, when they tell me.
    ID: 1012.0 Negative: But these things, these places have to be opened up. But November 4th, you’ll open. Don’t worry about it. But that’s a long time from now if you think about it, right? That’s a long time for now. In Biden’s policy manifesto written with socialist Bernie Sanders, Biden pledges to quickly outlaw American oil. He’s going to outlaw American oil, coal, American coal. He’s going to outlaw it. Natural gas, which is really an amazing form of energy, it clean, by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035. So he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels.
    ID: 304.0 Positive: Treat me with respect [crosstalk 00:09:31].
    ID: 478.0 Positive: If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn’t mean that’s going to stop. He doesn’t, he will never stop. If they win, it’s not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let’s face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That’s why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don’t think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn’t. So I’m running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You’ve seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you’ve never seen. They weren’t even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it’s got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home.
    ID: 1224.0 Positive: We’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-
    ID: 380.0 Negative: Next year, unless you have somebody that’s going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. There’s never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, he’s a beauty. He’s a beauty. He’s a beauty.
    ID: 954.0 Positive: And it’s very simple. You have that in deals. It’s whatever the lowest price in the world, we’re the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 25 cents for a pill and we’re paying $2.50 cents, and it’s not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn’t work. So they’ll go up a little bit. We’ll come way, way down. So I said, “Favored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We’re the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.”
    ID: 845.0 Positive: We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far.
    ID: 486.0 Positive: Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn’t think it, but I’ll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don’t understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again.
    ID: 512.0 Positive: Because we’ve really implemented things. We’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China’s never given us $0.10. It’s a one-way street with China. They haven’t given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It’s a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they’re smart, very smart. Instead of saying he’s not talking very nicely about us and we’re not going to order any more, we’re not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that’s what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done this before. With Biden it’s the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he’ll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them.
    ID: 814.0 Positive: 5) All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement’s endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and we’ll have a little discussion. We’ll ask why did that happen? They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that’s happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities.
    ID: 796.0 Negative: I’m now running in Texas against a man who’s against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas? I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Let’s put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldn’t win. You couldn’t win. Now, they’re not going to win. We’re going to win this. And you’re against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come.
    ID: 1020.0 Negative: In his joint manifesto with Bernie Sanders, Biden just called for a complete suspension of deportations, closing down detention facilities, ending border prosecutions. Think of this. Restoring and expanding catch and release, handing out free welfare to new arrivals, work permits for illegal crossers, and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens. Can you believe this? This is Bernie plus … I feel like Biden would be taken right. This is to show you how good a negotiate he is. Bernie took him left. It’s supposed to start and they’re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe, for them. For us it’s right of center. But Bernie actually took him left along with AOC plus three, right? AOC plus …
    ID: 813.0 Positive: 8) They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New York’s finest, right? Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally they’re not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York’s finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time they’ve done it.
    ID: 423.0 Positive: But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They weren’t even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years I’ve heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and we’ll be doing even better next year, you watch.
    ID: 871.0 Negative: Biden also vowed to oppose school choice, and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will expand charter schools, and provide school choice to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people.
    ID: 1047.0 Positive: These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right?
    ID: 197.0 Positive: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
    ID: 881.0 Positive: Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain, David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members, Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain. David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Great man.
    ID: 1110.0 Positive: You really are. You really are. You’re a state that despite everything, everything that they were saying, “Well, Wisconsin, can’t be one.” Guess what? And I think we’re way far ahead. I do believe we’re way far ahead. Where we were, if you look back four years, I think we have much more spirit. You see, this as easier in a sense. Now, the virus made it a little bit more difficult, maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden, something happened that nobody ever even thought about, but we handled it. We handled it and we handled it well. And we’re now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things. But the easier part is, I used to come up as a businessman. I was very successful. And I’d say, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to do tax cuts. We’re going to …”
    ID: 202.0 Positive: To me, Amtrak employees are family man, family. No one I think has ridden more on Amtrak than a conductor or engineer than me. I’ve made over two million miles on Amtrak they tell me. 36 years, every single day and then a lot when I was vice president.
    ID: 866.0 Negative: At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that is not because they don’t have one. It is because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which would totally collapse our rapidly improving economy, and once again record stock markets that we have right now, will also collapse. That means your 401(k)s, that means all of the stocks that you have.
    ID: 1158.0 Positive: Check out the words, favored nation, check out the word rebate, because now I take the rebate for the people and I take the rebate to reduce the prices. They took the rebate, went to a middleman. The middleman, I never heard the term middlewoman, but I guess probably that too. But the middleman got all this money, I don’t know who they are, nobody knows who they are. The middlemen, you always hear it, they made more money than the drug companies. At least the drug companies made a product, but the middleman is not liking Donald Trump too much. I probably have a lot of friends that are middlemen. I don’t even know if they have beautiful homes. I say, I wonder where they made their money? They’re very wealthy, but they’re not so wealthy anymore.
    ID: 711.0 Negative: That was the Obama rule. It was a disaster.
    ID: 862.0 Positive: We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country.
    ID: 587.0 Positive: We did it in Seattle. We told them we’re coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, “No, it’s going to be a summer of love.” These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we’re doing is we’re holding back funds for cities that don’t know what they’re doing, where they allow crime to run rampant.
    ID: 444.0 Positive: 4) I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, “We’re going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. We’re going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel.” Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents.
    ID: 805.0 Negative: 9) And the Dems don’t want it back for political reasons. But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And they’re saying that President Trump shut it down. I’m the one that wants it open. So they’re reversing it. They’re playing a big con game. It’s just a con game. And that’s what we’re dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. He’d be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now we’re opening it up and we’re opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible.
    ID: 815.0 Positive: 8) We will kill our terrorist’s enemies as we’ve been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. It’s such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. It’s incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And they’re really acting as police. They’re acting as police. Now, we’re very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. We’re getting out. We’ll be getting out soon. We’re very low in Iraq. We’re very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you don’t mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I’ve been saying.
    ID: 573.0 Positive: I can tell you, I am so happy to have helped because when I was first elected, you had things that were in such bad shape and now they’re fixed or being fixed at a cost of a lot of money, but they’re either fixed or being fixed and soon there’ll be in better condition than they were the day they were built, which was many, many decades ago. We have things that were built a long time ago that were in a state of disrepair that you wouldn’t believe. As long as I’m president of the United States, we will conserve this wondrous national inheritance from Key West to Key Biscayne, from Tampa to Tallahassee, from the Pensacola, beautiful Pensacola, I love Pensacola. I think it was 97%, that’s one of the reasons I like it. They say, “How’d you do in Pensacola?” I said, “Was that maybe 95? 97?” Right up there, so that helps. It’s amazing how that can help, isn’t it? Right here to Jupiter, which I know very well, we’ll preserve this glorious land for our children, for our grandchildren and for every generation of American to come.
    ID: 950.0 Negative: We’ve done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We’ve got things that they said you couldn’t get done. We’re energy independence. And they said, “We want to ban fracking.” No fracking. How do you think they’ll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There’s no fracking. There’s basically… They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay.
    ID: 538.0 Positive: 8) You ever see the statistics on young people? I don’t know. They have a great immune system. Let’s get some of that immune system, but they’re amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they’re not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It’s an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save-
    ID: 1068.0 Positive: Unfortunately, Fox has become fake news too. I don’t know what happens to these people, right? Do you agree? At least the other side, you know where they’re coming from. But I’ll use every tool at my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars. And that’s what we’re doing. When they were ripping down the statues, our great statues, they were ripping them down. I passed and signed something that’s beautiful. It says 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. Amazing.
    ID: 275.0 Positive: We have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans, to save our democracy, to be a light to the world once again, and finally, to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. My dad was an honorable, decent man. He got knocked down a few times, pretty hard, but he always got back up. He worked hard and he built a great middle class life for our family. He used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to understand them.” And then he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”
    ID: 65.0 Positive: UAW workers, steel workers, IBW workers. You’re the best craftsmen and women in the world. And you’re right here. If you’re ready to make it in America, then just like there are consequences for off showing, there will be rewards and incentives for creating good paying jobs here at home. Today, I’m announcing my new Made in America tax credit, a 10% advanceable tax credit for companies that invest in the United States and American workers, to help accelerate the recovery under our build back better agenda.
    ID: 1197.0 Positive: And we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters.
    ID: 191.0 Negative: Well, we know it’s been great for his rich friends, but it hasn’t been so great for the rest of us. Millions of people out of work. Evictions on the rise. 20 million people worrying about whether they’re going to lose their home because they have trouble making the mortgage payments. Health care being taken away, and Trump has a plan to gut Social Security. If his Social Security plan he actually puts forward, it actually became law, the Social Security actuary has said the entire Social Security system will be bankrupt by mid 2023. What in God’s name else can this guy do?
    ID: 818.0 Positive: 0) Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, “I wonder what happened?” And I did it all. I’ll be so angry at New Hampshire. I’ll never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what we’re doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. That’s going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And I’m the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
    ID: 686.0 Positive: Sure.
    ID: 708.0 Positive: That’s okay.
    ID: 885.0 Negative: We must reclaim our independence from the Left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted, trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of Cancel Culture is to make Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget.
    ID: 755.0 Negative: When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he’s a good guy, he’s a friend of mine, and that shouldn’t happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that’s what’s happening in Portland. And that’s what’s happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And we’re looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let’s see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. She’s always looking for money, “Could we have more money?” “What are you going to waste it on? I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor?”
    ID: 377.0 Positive: In fact, Biden was interviewed today on … There they are. CNN.
    ID: 262.0 Positive: Looking at the damage that has been done in her city, she said, “The violence and destruction doesn’t reflect my son or my family.” These are the words of a mom, a mother whose son had just been shot seven times in front of his children, badly injured, paralyzed, perhaps permanently. And even as she seeks justice for her son, she’s pleading for an end to the violence and for this nation to heal. She said she was praying for her son. Then she said something to me that that surprised me. She said she was praying for all police officers. She said was already been praying for America even before her son was shot. She’s publicly asked all of us to examine our hearts, citizens, elected officials, the police, all of us. And then she said, this. “We need healing. More than anything, that’s what we need to do as a nation. We need to heal.”
    ID: 534.0 Negative: Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we’ve had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, “No, we don’t have to bother. This is going to be…” And now we have to work against a guy that doesn’t know where he is, I can’t believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, “No, no, no, you don’t have to do that.” But I said, “We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they’re coming here,” so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move.
    ID: 99.0 Positive: Prison reform, there’s a whole lot of forms it takes. But my view is we should turn prison reform, and I’ve been preaching this for the last five years, from prison punishment to reform. So for example, anybody serves their time in prison and they get out, they should be entitled to every single program that exists under the federal government. Why don’t we want them getting a Pell Grant and going to school? Why don’t we want them getting a job and being able to get public housing, housing subsidies? Why don’t we want them qualifying for what used to be called food stamps? But right now, I wrote years ago with a guy named Specter, Senator from Pennsylvania, the Second Chance Act. Because right now we’re in a situation where you get out of prison, and I think you all know this, you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. By the way, 93% of everybody, 93 out of every 100 prisoners in prison are behind a city jail, a county jail, a state jail, not a federal prison. Barack were I are able to reduce the prison population federally by 38,000 folks.
    ID: 440.0 Positive: We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, “And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that you’ve never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have.” They said, “Is he giving away military information?” No, I’m saying, “We have the greatest weapons in the world.” That’s what I’m saying. They said, “He may be giving away classified information.” You don’t have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because you’re giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There’s nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right?
    ID: 4.0 Positive: This is a special place for the Biden family. My daughter, Ashley, a social worker, was a caseworker here helping young people who are aging out of foster care. When my son was the Attorney General, Beau came here, right here, to learn more about job training programs for those working toward a GED and a certificate for a good paying job. When I was senator and vice president, there were plenty of economists I had around me to talk about every aspect of the economy. But I always think about the people who walked through the doors here. Working people, white, Black, brown, Latino. What are they doing? Are they okay? I knew if they’re okay, they walk through these doors, the economy was doing okay. If they weren’t okay, we weren’t doing well.
    ID: 67.0 Negative: These two steps on top of my plans to close each and every one of the Trump loopholes that he created in 2017 with his tax cut to reward companies with big tax breaks for off shoring. That’s going to end. If you’re going to want to build things here in the United States, because under our administration, the Biden Harris Administration, is going to deliver on the promise to buy American. It’s been a law for almost a century, but we’ve never lived up to it. The idea is simple.
    ID: 524.0 Positive: And it’s a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It’s such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I’d see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they’d make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn’t work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA.
    ID: 1097.0 Negative: Look at all those people back, that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Look at all the fake news. Isn’t that incredible. That’s a lot of fake news back there, Scott. At the end of Joe Biden’s eight years as vice president, nearly 2 million Americans of prime working age had dropped out of the workforce. Our factories were stolen. Our country was doing lousy. He lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. He was, by the way, a disaster on swine flu. He got a horrible rating in Gallup. Look at the Gallup poll. So they call it H1N1 right? You remember? H1 swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1, but I don’t hold them in that one. That’s one of the small mistake. The bigger mistakes is what he says He’s at a different state when he’s speaking. “Great to be in the great state of Ohio,” but no, no, no, we’re not in Ohio.
    ID: 1153.0 Negative: Joe Biden supported every globalist attack on the American worker, NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which I didn’t allow to happen, the horrible Korea deal. South China’s entry into the World Trade Organization might’ve been the worst of them all, it created China. Now Biden is running on the most extreme far-left agenda ever put forward by a major party. Biden’s joint manifesto, we call it a manifesto, with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, would raise taxes and increase regulations at an unprecedented rate. He will kill the stock market, he will kill everything that we’re talking about today. He’d also abolish immigration enforcement, abolish bail, abolish the suburbs, abolish effective policing, abolish American energy, and abolish the American way of life, otherwise, he’d do quite a good job, I think.
    ID: 471.0 Negative: This is the most important election we’ve ever had. 56 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don’t think you has a bigger difference and maybe you’ve never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don’t want to say it because I’ll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children’s future to countries like China.
    ID: 1016.0 Positive: Senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and Biden wants to eliminate power plants all across America. You had a problem over here. But think of that, if they do that, get used to no air conditioning. They probably don’t want that either. Under my administration, we ended the war on American energy and I put the miners back to work. We put them back to work. The miners are back to work now. I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipelines almost right at the beginning. I just approved them right at the beginning and a lot of jobs. And by the way, it’s a much cleaner form of transportation.
    ID: 430.0 Positive: The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. That’s not happening anymore. That’s not happening anymore.
    ID: 1036.0 Negative: They want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories, and all of your jobs, and all of your personal things. You know, little things, and they laugh at it when I say it. The light bulb. Those new expensive light bulbs. I said, “What happened to the old ones? They’re better.” They said, “They were mandated out.” I said, “Why?” Nobody could explain why. I said, ” We’re letting them back. The light bulbs are back.” Dishwashers. They have dishwashers they don’t give you any water. They give you not enough water, so they’re lousy. So what do people do? They press the button again, and again. No water. I let them have lots of water.
    ID: 542.0 Positive: 2) We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We’ll build up our military like it’s never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had by far.
    ID: 938.0 Positive: So, we have a big one coming.
    ID: 1148.0 Positive: The fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by 85% since April. We’ve learned, we know, we have some great things now too. Europe by contrast has experienced a 40% higher rate of excess mortality than the United States. Think about that, you don’t hear those stories, they don’t tell you that Tom, do they? You don’t hear that in Congress, right? We launched the largest mobilization of American goods since the World War II. Think of it, since World War II. This is the largest mobilization since World War II, creating the most advanced testing system in the world, producing thousands of ventilators and launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver and distribute a vaccine before the end of the year in record time. We’re at a very, very close point to the vaccine and to therapeutics and therapeutics to me are more important right now. You go into the hospital, whether it’s a transfusion or whether it’s a shot and you feel better two days later or a day later or three days later but now would be a great thing and we’re very close, we have great, great companies working on it.
    ID: 1065.0 Negative: During a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died. That’s worse than Afghanistan, which we’re getting out of. That’s worse than Iraq, which we’re almost out of. That’s worse than Syria, which we’re out of, except we kept the oil, but that’s okay. We don’t have to talk about that. But this is the future that Joe Biden plans to bring to every city, town, and suburb in our nation. And you know, for those suburbs, I keep hearing about suburban women. I made the … Oh. Well, in one speech recently, I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it, but what I got, they said, “Sir, I don’t know if that’s politically correct.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. They’ll get over it.” Right? But we saved the suburbs. The suburbs, and you know what I’m talking about. And they said about the rule, it’s a rule. Very strong. It’s like a law. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “No, I don’t want it amended.” “No, we can really amend it. Bring it down.” “No, I don’t want it. I want it terminated.” And we terminated it. It’s gone. And it’ll be re-instituted if Joe Biden comes in.
    ID: 185.0 Positive: Roughly two-thirds of the American people, roughly two-thirds of them in this country, have a favorable opinion of unions. That matches the highest approval rating Gallup has shown in over 50 years. It’s something I’ve always believed, you’ve always known. My uncle in Scranton, Uncle Ed, used to say, “Joe, you’re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole.” Well, I didn’t have much of a choice, the way I was raised at my grandfather’s table. I’ve never been afraid to say the word “union,” not when I grew up, not today. And you can be sure you’ll be hearing that word “union” plenty of times, if I’m in the White House.
    ID: 1172.0 Positive: Congress woman Ilhan Omar-
    ID: 1127.0 Positive: I learned that when I came up here, they had specialty milk, a little thing, specialty milk. And I met a farmer and he said what had happened with specialty milk. And that got me over the edge. And I said, “We got to change this,” because you were taken, Tom. You were taken advantage of by Canada very badly and by Mexico and by China and by Japan and by friends and foe. And in many cases, friends who are worse than the foe. For years, you watched as politicians like Sleepy Joe Biden who’s been in office for 47 years, allowed foreign nations to crush Minnesota’s mining. Look at your mining industry, it was crushed by dumping tons and tons of cheap iron and steel into our country. I saw what was happening. I did something about it. I did something about it.
    ID: 806.0 Negative: 1) But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. You’d have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because it’s not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. We’re going to throw that all out? We have a market… You know, your stock market. Who has 401k’s here? Your 401k’s and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, S&P and NASDAQ, you’re at new records. And you’re about to hit another new record.
    ID: 1066.0 Negative: Not by him, because he has no idea what the law says or what it means, but by the people that will be running our country. It will not be him. It will not be him running our country. They will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn’t mind. No one will be safe in a Biden run America. But while I’m president, the United States will use every tool and we’ve done it. By the way, our country is doing great. We have the pandemic should have never been allowed to happen by China. Should’ve never been allowed to happen.
    ID: 1017.0 Positive: America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Think of that one. To protect our great steelworkers … Do you have a couple of … Any steelworkers here by the way? To protect our great steelworkers, I placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap, foreign steel all over the place. And we have created an incredible industry out of nothing. It was ready to go out. Within months, steel imports dropped by 26% and American steel production surged by 18 million tons, almost immediately. Biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless, but he didn’t save the steel industry. We saved the steel industry. You wouldn’t have a steel industry right now.
    ID: 525.0 Positive: In the face of China’s economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we’re not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it’s just been this way for 20 years. Now, it’s going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn’t do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn’t do that, I think you wouldn’t have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, “Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?” He said, “Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.”
    ID: 293.0 Positive: You’re telling me.
    ID: 1080.0 Positive: So, before the virus came in from China, unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded. Ever recorded. That was part of Scott’s thing too. I have to give him a little credit there, right? I have to do that. But we created 15,000 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs. Everybody said that would be impossible. 121, 000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100,000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good jobs.
    ID: 895.0 Positive: 6) Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are.
    ID: 115.0 Positive: [inaudible 00:51:16].
    ID: 918.0 Positive: Thank you.
    ID: 322.0 Positive: Please welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris.
    ID: 241.0 Positive: Everybody thinks that we’ve led the world because we’re the most powerful nation in the world. And it’s true. We are. But we’ve not led by the example of our power. It’s been the power of our example.
    ID: 277.0 Positive: And with newly empowered labor unions. They’re the ones that build the middle class. With equal pay for women, with rising wages you could raise a child on, a family on. And yes, we’re going to do more than praise our essential workers. We’re finally going to pay them. Pay them. We can and we will deal with climate change. It’s not only a crisis, it’s an enormous opportunity, an opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new, good-paying jobs in the process. And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes, and the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all. Because we don’t need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I’m not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it’s long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.
    ID: 40.0 Positive: Oh, I do. Absolutely, I do. I do. And I think that’s the thing, recognizing Israel as an independent Jewish state. I think that’s important. But also, I believe that Israel has to be prepared to work toward a genuine two state solution. Thank you all very much.
    ID: 1079.0 Positive: I’ll tell you one thing. He’s one of the most respected men. He goes into Washington, everybody stands up. They really do respect him a lot. And it’s really something. The next time you run, please don’t put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you’re running. You brought out like a million people that nobody ever knew were coming out, right? Because there was no way, but you can do whatever you want. You know that. You’re going to be successful, whatever you want to do. Thank you very much God for being here.
    ID: 355.0 Positive: … Do, dignity, honor, treating people with dignity. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, and the full diversity of the Latino communities. Now, when I mean full diversity, unlike the African-American community and many other communities, you’re from everywhere. They’re from Europe, from the tip of South America, all the way to our border in Mexico and in the Caribbean. And different backgrounds. Different ethnicities, but all Latinos. We’re going to get a chance to do that if we win in November. It means we need everyone to get out and vote. I can’t do this without your help.
    ID: 334.0 Positive: One of the reasons I chose Kamala is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word, possibilities. Possibilities. Let me say it again, possibilities. That’s America. That’s what sets this nation apart, is that everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone, and we mean everyone, to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their God-given ability will take them.
    ID: 804.0 Positive: 1) And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. I’m the one that’s been saying. Is that a correct statement? I want football back. These are young, strong guys. They’re not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, it’s generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. They’ll be just fine. But I want football back. I’ve been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10.
    ID: 1015.0 Negative: We say, “You got to get rid of the leaves. You got to get rid of the debris. You got to get rid of the fallen trees.” You know when a tree falls, after 13 to 14 months, it becomes extremely dry. You look at some of these fires, they don’t really catch where the trees are growing because they’re wet. The water’s pouring up the tree. And they just don’t want to listen. They mocked us when I said that you got to clean your floors, just an expression. Clean the floors. And they have many, many years, decades of leaves, dry leaves. And that’s why they have it. There are other places, forest cities, they’re forests, they were developed in forests and they don’t have any problem, with more flammable trees than you have in California, but they just don’t want to do it.
    ID: 366.0 Negative: If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win.
    ID: 383.0 Negative: I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but there’s never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate that’s so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that’s what he’s going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment.
    ID: 63.0 Positive: Well, nearly 20,000 auto manufacturing jobs have been lost in Michigan under Trump. Nearly 80,000 were created during the Obama Biden administration. I’ve got long history. I’m not just talking about what I’m going to do, but delivering results for Michiganders. And now, we need to do it again. We need to do the hard work, not only to recover, but to build the economy back for the future once more. That’s why my build back better agenda, that’s what it’s all about. Starts right here with you in the union halls, all across America. Back in July, I made the first plank in my agenda a plan to modernize American manufacturing and technology to ensure that the future is made in America, by all of you. And today, I’m announcing some additional steps to make this plank even stronger.
    ID: 928.0 Positive: Now we’re in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we’re going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We’re going to win this election.
    ID: 670.0 Positive: 6) They can’t believe it. The drug companies can’t believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where’s Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It’s all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let’s see what happens, but we’re going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you’ve never seen. We’ll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always.
    ID: 896.0 Positive: 6) Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets, and bayonets to rescue American liberty. They had no fear. But America did not stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a six-million-pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible.
    ID: 957.0 Positive: You could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn’t it be a kick… I’ll use this, wouldn’t it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden’s done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great-
    ID: 351.0 Negative: If I’m elected president, we’re going to immediately end Trump’s assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. We’re going to restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and those fleeing violence and persecution. My Lord, we’ve never made asylum seekers stay, seek asylum outside the United States of America. We’re going to stop the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents and work to reunite families. Look at all the families that are not reunited. We’re going to stop detaining people and definitely invest instead on case management programs to help ensure migrants get the support they need while they’re navigating the asylum process. It’s going to cost a lot of money, but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than building a wall. We’re going to restore a sensible enforcement priorities and stop terrorizing Latino communities.
    ID: 84.0 Positive: No I’ll wait. [crosstalk 00:00:15:13].
    ID: 343.0 Positive: So the question you ask Arturo, how are we going to make real a better life for Latinos? That’s the key question, and the future of our country literally depends on how we answer it. That’s how important it is. Because here’s the God’s honest truth, the future success that our country are going to depend on our ability to make sure Latinos have opportunities and the tools to succeed. Latino is among the fastest growing population in the United States. Already one quarter of our school children, one quarter of our school children are Latino. How in God’s name can we have a strong and thriving Republic if we don’t fully deal Latinos into every aspect of American life? These kids are not someone else’s kids, they’re our kids. The kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft.
    ID: 1083.0 Positive: And this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers. That is something that people really … I’ll tell you, the great economists, that’s what they wanted. The payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies. Number one, they open their business. It’s great for them, but really great for you, and it’s a big saving. It’s a lot of money in your pocket. If Republicans win in November, we will forgive these payments in full.
    ID: 930.0 Positive: I’m just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You’re sitting there, you get a ballot. Here’s the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That’s why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good.
    ID: 18.0 Negative: I’ve been a big supporter of mental health, I’d recommend that people who believe it maybe should take advantage while it still exists in the Affordable Care Act. It’s bizarre, totally bizarre. And now, have you guys found that planeload of people in uniforms, and weapons, and flying around? I mean, have you found them yet? Is there anybody even from… By the way, I respect conservatism and liberal points of view in the press. Anybody found that plane? What in God’s name are we doing? Look at how it makes us look around the world, it’s mortified, it’s embarrassing, and it’s dangerous. If the president doesn’t know better, which I… He has to know better, and my Lord we’re in much more trouble than I ever thought we were. It’s bizarre.
    ID: 155.0 Positive: I think we should let the judicial system work its way. I do think there’s a minimum need to be charged, the officers, and as well as Breonna Taylor and I might add, by the way, I think what happened in Portland where one of the Trump guys riding along in vans and inciting responses were shooting rubber bullets, I guess, or paint balls. Apparently there was someone shot by someone in the crowd with a bullet, killed. I think that person should meet legal requirements, whatever that calls for. He should be investigated and it should follow through on what needs to be done. Let the judicial system work. Let’s make sure justice is done.
    ID: 1188.0 Positive: Over the next four years, we will fully restore America’s manufacturing independence. We will again rebuild the greatest economy in history. It’s happening very fast. You’re going to see it very soon. I’d lift it to even more incredible heights than what we had last year. You had the greatest year in the history of your state last year. We will revitalize police departments and reclaim our cities for law abiding Americans. We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of our beautiful unborn children, appoint conservative judges, uphold free speech on college campuses, and safeguard the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms.
    ID: 325.0 Positive: Kamala, as you all know is smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class, for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She’s ready to do this job on Day One and we’re both ready to get to work, rebuilding this nation and building it better. As attorney general of the largest state in the country, Kamala took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and won. Took on big oil that wanted to pollute without consequences. She was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby. You know, we’ve all watched her in the United States Senate go toe to toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was.
    ID: 639.0 Negative: 0) He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the entire world. Remember that? Now he’s trying to say, “Well I can be tough on China too.” No he can’t. China owns him. China owns Sleepy Joe. He’s not going to be tough on China and he said all these wonderful things and then all of a sudden his poll numbers started going down. How about law enforcement? He’s like so bad. In his entire convention, they didn’t even mention, and by the way, something else they did that I think is terrible, really terrible. The words under God, right? Right? Right? Called the Pledge of Allegiance. Under God, he left those two words out twice at their caucus which is part of their convention. But that’s where they’re coming from. He’s trying this, “Oh well we didn’t do this,” and then we gave it to him and he sort of shut up but then two days later he’s saying it didn’t happen. They lie and these mail-in ballots? These mail-in ballots are a disgrace [inaudible 01:08:46].
    ID: 718.0 Positive: Prison reform, criminal justice reform.
    ID: 829.0 Positive: For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent first lady. Thank you sweetheart. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children. Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother, and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.
    ID: 1007.0 Negative: He’s got to open this state up. You know when he’s going to open it up? No, I know what he’s doing. Because a lot of them are doing it, doing it in the great State of North Carolina, right? They’re doing it in North Carolina. But they’re doing it in a lot of different areas. They’ve got to open this state up and you have to do it, right? This wonderful, incredible Commonwealth. Right? I would call it a Commonwealth. Do you ever mind of they call it a state? No, call it Commonwealth. Whatever the hell you want to open it up. And what is he doing? What is he doing? So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we’re going to get it open. And I know when he’s going to do it. You know when it is? November 4th. November 4th, he’s going to say, “Well, we’re going to open it up.”
    ID: 144.0 Negative: From the start to finish, the American families and our children are paying the price for his failures; failure to take this virus seriously early on in January and February and it spread around the globe, failure to take steps we needed back in March and April to get this pandemic under controlled institute widespread testing and tracing to control the spread, failure to provide clear national science-based guidelines to state and local authorities, and failure to model even basic responsibility like socially distancing and wearing a mask, and failure to make sure educators and administrators have the equipment, the resources, and the training they need to open safe and under the circumstances we find now.
    ID: 1121.0 Positive: It’s a great group. And man whose name I love, Lacy Johnson. Great job. I’ve been following you, Lacy. You’re doing good. You’re doing good. Thank you, Lacy very much. We really have to get them. They’re warriors, all of them, all of them. We have to get them in because we have to stop this craziness that’s going on. No law enforcement, no anything. They don’t know what they’re doing. They’ll lose the country. You know, there’s somebody said the other day and I say it very strongly, “Sir, you’re the only one between that and the greatness of the American dream.” And there’s truth to it. We don’t stop. We don’t keep this position. We’re going to win the House. I feel confident we’re going to win the House.
    ID: 580.0 Positive: Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I don’t know if you saw this, if there’s any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we’re trying to get them in. And I’d love to get them in. I mean, it’s an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We’re doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can’t do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don’t have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here.
    ID: 678.0 Positive: It’s been horrible the last 90 days. But no, it’s been going on for many… It’s been going on for many, many years. It’s like, you’re in, I won’t name the city, but it’s the city someplace in the world that’s not so good, okay? It’s a terrible situation.
    ID: 981.0 Positive: There’s only one thing standing between your family and the radical left wing mob, and that’s your vote this November. This is a very important … I feel like I’m a wall. You know, we built the wall on the Southern border. We’re going to have 300 miles by two weeks from now, even less, 300 miles. And by the end of the year, we’ll be up to almost 500 miles, and then we’re going to go on a little bit further, some areas that are loose, a little bit loose. We found out. We’re going to put a little bit more, about 536 miles going up at a record clip. It’s doing phenomenally well.
    ID: 509.0 Positive: What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It’s going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall’s going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don’t put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president’s been great, he’s a friend of mine, he’s doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico’s not easy, but he’s doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it’s a tremendous wall. It’s everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, “What else do you want?” It’s wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, “We don’t want a wall, we want drones flying.” Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right?
    ID: 1098.0 Negative: You know what you know what you do when that happens? You just walk off because there’s nothing you can do to recover. It’s happened to him like what, six times? Almost every time. That’s why he doesn’t talk. He’s shot, he’s shot. We got to say, look, one thing I’ve learned Putin, President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un, Erdogan of Turkey. They are world-class chess players. We can’t have a guy who’s shot and in his best years wasn’t very good. He wasn’t very good. We can’t have, these guys are world-class chess players.
    ID: 758.0 Positive: Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it? We sent in because-
    ID: 1219.0 Negative: By contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. [Rudy 00:13:17] started that. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America.
    ID: 1059.0 Positive: No, no, no. Frankly, their pollster’s much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right. Fox pollster I don’t know who he is, but he hasn’t had a clue for about seven years. Let me just tell you that CNN gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we went up and now they call it margin of error. Don’t believe it. We’re way beyond the margin of error don’t believe it.
    ID: 625.0 Positive: Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas?
    ID: 71.0 Positive: We’re going to build on all the new infrastructure we’re going to build on highways. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations across America, providing prevailing wage jobs for the IBW and other craftsmen all across the country. And by offering rebates and incentives to swap older fuel efficient vehicles for new clean American made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. And together, this will mean, listen to me now, 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, 1 million. With supply chain, as well as the associated infrastructure, we can do this. We can do this. We can revitalize our industrial base as the heart of the American middle class.
    ID: 1189.0 Positive: We will ensure American dominance in space and in military and pave the way to becoming the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. We’re working on that, we’re doing very well. By the way when I took over NASA, it was dead. It was gone, right? It was gone. There was nothing. There was grass growing on the runways… grass, through the crevices on the runway. It was terrible and now it’s the most vital space program anywhere in the world. Not only the jobs, but the importance of it and the psychology of it, and by the way, for military defense. And we created Space Force. Think of that, we created another one of many, many things. First time in 78 years. Last one was the Air Force, right? Space Force, that’s a big deal. By itself. If a president did that, they would have achieved something. We did that and we did hundreds of other things.
    ID: 1227.0 Positive: What is better?
    ID: 1232.0 Negative: That’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.
    ID: 1045.0 Positive: Like your area. This has always been a Democrat area, and yet the votes for Trump here are through the roof. You know how successful we were four years ago. Incredible. It’s a great area. These are great people. They’re great, hardworking, incredible people, and we love them. With your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on November 3rd, and we will make America greater than it’s ever been before. I just want to thank the people of Scranton, the lack of home, okay, the lack of home for Joe Biden.
    ID: 787.0 Positive: After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we’re taking care of our people.
    ID: 732.0 Positive: Well, once you get to a certain number, we use the word herd, right? Once you get to a certain number, it’s going to go away. So, it doesn’t have to be. But yeah, I mean, a lot of people are not going to want to do it. A lot of people don’t want to do the flu vaccine.
    ID: 1101.0 Negative: Among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record of failure and betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office. We got our people back working. We made real deals with foreign countries.
    ID: 926.0 Negative: But other than that, they’re very, very bad. There’ll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they’re thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can’t control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won’t get into because I don’t want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It’s the fake news. I don’t want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they’re trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that’s what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included-
    ID: 660.0 Negative: 4) If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there’s another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible.
    ID: 691.0 Negative: Oh, the Democrats had no control. It actually got out of control even for them. I signed in an executive order, 10 years in jail if you knock down a statue or monument. You haven’t heard one thing about it. You haven’t. We wouldn’t have… They were going after Thomas Jefferson, they were going after Lincoln. And they were going after the Washington monument, that they could knock that one down. They were going after it. And I actually don’t even think they know. I think they’re just thugs. I don’t think it’s… It may be an ideology and it may not. It is an ideology for the people that are paying them. And the funny thing is, and the strange thing is, the people that are paying them and all this money, because somebody’s doing it [crosstalk 00:11:49] The people paying them, those people will be overthrown. Their lives will be taken away. Their lives will be endangered. They’re all going to be gone. They’re just stupid foolish people that made a lot of money.
    ID: 624.0 Positive: Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he’s like a lamb, he’s like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don’t we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? 12 years I think. Rick right? 12? Tell me. 14? 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he’s been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I’ll never repeat again. Even my own family didn’t like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there’s nobody that’s said better things about me. But you’re great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you’ve been, you’ve been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you.
    ID: 210.0 Positive: This is about the American people I’m talking to now. It’s about the people that are doing the job. It’s about all of you listening, your jobs, your communities. Now more than ever, you deserve better. We should all be taking this fight to Trump and to McConnell. Make them stop playing political games with the heroes who really are keeping this nation going. And then as president, I’ll guarantee all workers, all workers have a right to collectively bargain. So even those who’ve seen the rights stripped away in states like Wisconsin and Iowa once again can negotiate for better wages and working conditions and have a stronger voice on the job.
    ID: 1193.0 Positive: Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [crosstalk 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [crosstalk 00:00:44]. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is.
    ID: 682.0 Negative: I don’t know. No, I think that like the Mayor Wheeler, I think he’s probably afraid for his life. Because if you would have seen him… But I’ll show you, had this on NBC news put on and they didn’t have the people shouting, they had him standing there, and they talked about how it was a show of great unity. The mayor standing with the people. Those people were going to kill him. They were saying things that I can’t repeat right now, but horrible things. But they didn’t put that on. I actually happened to see the real tape on Fox. He escaped with his life, and yet he doesn’t want any help. It’s so unfair to the people of Oregon. We could solve that problem quickly. Like I did in Kenosha. You know, Kenosha went through three or four days of that. You wouldn’t have a Kenosha right now. We demanded that they send in the National Guard. Called the governor. And in all fairness, the governor did it. Not enough, but it was enough to put it out. And we ultimately put in where we had 1,000 people and we put it out quickly. You wouldn’t have Kenosha right now.
    ID: 575.0 Negative: So thank you Pennsylvania, very much. I’m thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. He’s trying to change now. We say that’s not working because we’re going up and he’s dropping like a rock in water.
    ID: 8.0 Positive: Anyone with a big enough checkbook can get rapid tests on demand. If you don’t, you might have to wait in line for hours and wait for weeks to get your result, if you can get them at all. You have the kind of job where you can work from a laptop at home remotely, risking getting COVID is very small at work. This job report shows that 37 million people reported teleworking in August. But if you work in an assembly line or check out counter or a meat packing plant or drive a truck or deliver packages, you’re at much greater risk. And the job report shows that more than 27 million workers reported that they couldn’t work or lost hours because their employer had to close or lost business due to the pandemic.
    ID: 174.0 Negative: Well, that’s wonderful. We’re in a position we’re in now. Look at other countries. They’re doing one hell of a lot better. Yet, we still have over, what’s it up to, 186,000 people dead. Over 6 million, was it, 6, ,000, whatever the number is, that have contracted the disease and no end in sight. It’s just irresponsible. Talk about a no-nothing Congress. On the Republican side. No, not even the president. I mean, I don’t get it. I really don’t get it, but it’s going to change, come January, God willing.
    ID: 166.0 Positive: That’s right.
    ID: 1005.0 Positive: But he was a fantastic man, actually. He was a good man. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history, nothing even close. We added seven million jobs nationwide, including 209,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. By the way, in the last three months, right Bernie? Over nine million jobs, an all time record. This is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic. You notice how they, anytime there’s a good country, they like to compare, because we’ve done an incredible job. You look at our mortality rates, you look at all the things. But they like to compare us to others. So they were talking about New Zealand. New Zealand, it’s over, it’s over for Zealand. Everything’s gone. They’re beautiful. They had a massive breakout yesterday. South Korea, it’s over, it’s over. Big breakout yesterday. It’s a tough deal.
    ID: 476.0 Negative: A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody’s ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We’re going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We’re saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We’ll straighten it out in less than a half an hour.
    ID: 1099.0 Negative: They’re all dreaming of Joe Biden. I’ll tell you who’s dreaming about them is Iran. If we win, and when we win, we are going to have a deal with Iran immediately. They’re just waiting, hoping that Biden gets in. Hoping John Kerry is saying, “Oh, he should have…” He, by the way, if anybody violated the Logan Act, it was John Kerry. John Kerry, not General Flynn. John Kerry.
    ID: 581.0 Positive: No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I’d do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have.
    ID: 449.0 Positive: 5) I said, “I gave away nothing.” “No, he gave away so much.” When I said, “What did they give away?” You know what they said? “Uh, we don’t know.” I said, “Here’s what I gave away, I gave away nothing.” They said, “Oh, but you agreed to meet.” Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now they’re saying, “I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal.”
    ID: 464.0 Positive: 1) Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they’re running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust.
    ID: 553.0 Positive: To safeguard our stunning coastal areas, I signed legislation authorizing $100 million to fight the red tide and toxic algae and to preserve the Everglades and defend Florida from catastrophic flooding. You know about the flooding. We spent a lot of money on flooding and a lot of money on hurricanes and when your governors came to me and they said, “Can we have this? Can we have that? We need some more for the Panhandle,” they said, “We have to help the panhandle.” I said, “Without question and without any wait, let’s go.” Right? That’s what we said. You’ve never had it so easy in your life. He’d walk into my office, say, “Sir, just one more.” “How much is it going to cost? How about an extra billion?”
    ID: 308.0 Positive: That’s exactly right [crosstalk 00:12:34].
    ID: 811.0 Negative: 9) They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong. She’s one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, “I’m going to leave because I’ve decided that I want to leave. I want to leave.” She left because she wouldn’t have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she’s not competent. She’s not competent. They’re all saying we want Ivanka. I don’t blame them. They want to eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. That’s what we need is more lawyers. Let’s get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why? Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I’m able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy? Not too well. And we had the best year we’ve ever had.
    ID: 983.0 Positive: We gave all of our ex-army equipment. We have tremendous surplus equipment, and it was sitting in warehouses all over the United States. Hundreds of millions of dollars, I distributed it to the police, whereas Biden and Obama, they didn’t want to do that because they said, no, no, no. It makes the police look too strong. I want the police to look strong. You got to look strong. And a lot of it was protective equipment.
    ID: 195.0 Negative: He’ll never understand. He’ll never understand you, he’ll never understand us, he’ll never understand our cops, our firefighters, because he’s not made of the same stuff that the people who serve this nation are made of. Like so many of you, you live by a code, an American code. Sounds corny, but it’s real. Honor. Duty. Country. Something bigger than yourself. He lives by a code of lies, greed and selfishness. This is Labor Day and we honor all that working folks have done for the people of this country. We honor you, your work, your courage, your commitment to this country. And I promise you this, if you give me the honor-
    ID: 90.0 Positive: And my son Beau was alive then. He was the attorney general of the state of Delaware at the time. And my daughter, who’s a social worker, ran the largest criminal justice program in the state. And my son, my middle son, who was running the World Food Health Program, The World Food Program USA, the largest program in the world. I call them up and all of a sudden it hit me. Here I was and that whole area has been rebuilt. And third street bridge is still in a little bit of trouble, but things have moved. And I said, “Don’t tell me things can’t change.” I told them about the story.
    ID: 999.0 Positive: They said manufacturing jobs will never come back. Remember, you need a magic wand. Where’s the magic wand? Well, we have the magic wand. My first week in office, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific partnership. It would have been totally destructive to your jobs. It would have been a horror show. I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord, which would have cost us so many billions of dollars. And all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world. I believe it was designed to hurt the United States and to get jobs away from us and companies. I stood up to China’s rampant cheating, plunder, and theft. I repealed that horrible tax. So many taxes. How many taxes did I repeal? I’m getting a list of them now, I’ll have it for you for the next meeting. Because I’ll be back to Pennsylvania, that I promise. And I’m standing up to the special interests and to big pharma. Weeks ago, I signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs.
    ID: 1002.0 Positive: We’re honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine, but they really fight. These Pennsylvania people are fighters, in case you haven’t noticed. Representative Scott Perry. Scott, where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Great job, Scott. The warriors. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. John Joyce. John, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a friend of mine and a great, great man. He would have been here forever if he decided to, but he decided maybe it was time to do something else. But this was a fighter like no other fighter. And those three other gentlemen will attest, right? Our friend Lou Barletta. Lou. And they’re shouting. I’m saying this for the media. They’re shouting “Lou”, they’re not booing. They’ll say, “He stood up and he got booed horribly. It was a horrible embarrassing.” No, that’s what they do. They’re fake. Thanks also to our congressional candidates, Jim Bognet. Jim, oh, look at him. I’ve heard good things, Jim. Is it easy out there on the stump?
    ID: 949.0 Positive: And hydro, I love. It’s one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That’s the Great Dams. You don’t see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, “You can’t build a dam there.” But now we can, because we’ve done-
    ID: 57.0 Positive: During a pandemic, we’re seeing not only the inequity of this policy, but the enormous vulnerability that this creates for our own health security. And our security requires us to have supply chains of the necessary drugs based here, not overseas. Not overseas in times of crisis.
    ID: 367.0 Positive: But I wouldn’t worry about it because he’s not winning. I don’t think he’s winning.
    ID: 234.0 Negative: There’s still a significant effort in this administration to make it more difficult for Americans to vote. When you and I get elected, God willing, we’re going to push hard to make voting, Election Day, a national holiday, so people don’t have to take off work. There should be same day registration. We’re the greatest democracy in the world and voter turnout is being pushed by the other team to be lowered. What are they afraid of? I think they’re afraid of people showing up and voting.
    ID: 913.0 Positive: I say, “So Governor, so I’m at 19,000, you’re at 10. Can we work something in the middle.” It didn’t sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have … I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let’s have our big deal, the roll call, let’s have it right here and let’s do it and I’m going to show up and I’m not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what’s more important than the roll call? You’re the ones calling it so what’s more important –
    ID: 466.0 Positive: 1) So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It’s the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That’s right. That’s right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day.
    ID: 132.0 Positive: 5) We got to be honest with them and say, “You got to step up. You got to step up. We got to do a lot more, a lot more than we’ve done.” Because this is the first chance we’ve had in a generation, in my view, to deal and cut another slice off institutional racism toward getting the place where change is. And by the way, the main reason why I’m optimistic because of your generation, black, white, Hispanic, and Asian American. Did you ever think you’d turn on a TV… You’re much younger than I am, but you’re a little older than she is.
    ID: 233.0 Positive: Shelby v. Holder. One of the things that I’m worried about is there is a whole new effort of Jim Crow out there. You have over, I think it’s over, I think it’s 33 states roughly that have passed laws, something like 80-some laws that make it harder to vote.
    ID: 1151.0 Positive: So they take a lot of the goods that they can’t distribute, because the post office is massive, much bigger than those companies, believe it or not, you wouldn’t think it, but much, much bigger. And they go to areas of Minnesota, and other states that you can’t reach, you’ll never reach, and they just dump thousands of packages into the post office and they say, “Good luck. Here’s your $2. Here’s your $1. Here’s your 52 cents.” Now we got to do that. So that’s my opinion. What do I know about delivery? What do I know? That’s my opinion. That’s a new business, but we’re being taken advantage of by all of those companies, and they should pay, not the people.
    ID: 636.0 Negative: 3) These maniacs, any time … They always talk about Russia, they never talk about China. It’s very interesting. It’s always Russia, I heard it’s starting again, they said somebody spoke to Russia two years ago. Russia, Russia, Russia. This total maniac Shifty Schiff, he’s a total maniac. Do you ever notice, I can’t even listen to him but when I hear Russia I just turn it off. It’s crazy but you know getting along with countries is actually a good thing. Can we explain thing? It’s a good thing, not a bad thing. It’s a very good thing. Remember I was the one that was going to be leading you into war, in the first week, he’ll be in war, he’s a radical kind of a personality. I’m really not, I like to have peace, but if we ever do get into war, we will knock the hell out of them, whoever [inaudible 01:05:41]. These guys only fight to tie, they don’t fight to win, you fight to win.
    ID: 822.0 Positive: 5) America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked.
    ID: 1133.0 Positive: They didn’t have to pay the tariffs. This was before my time. How this could have happened is incredible. So I said, “Listen, if you don’t change your tariffs, I’m going to put your tariffs on your car.” It was amazing. They said, “We’ll change them immediately.” Thank you very much. That took about two minutes. So I did a lot for Maine. We’re going to see whether or not they remember but I think Maine’s going to remember but I did similar for you when I opened up your great iron ore and I put tariffs, I put tariffs on foreign steel and the Iron Range came roaring back to life. You know that, right? Right?
    ID: 684.0 Positive: No, I don’t want them to. I want to leave it to law enforcement. But my supporters are wonderful, hardworking, tremendous people. And they turn on their television set, and they look at a Portland or they look at a Kenosha before I got involved and stopped it. Or they look at Chicago, where 78 people were shot last week and then numerous people died. Or they look at New York where violence is up by like what, 150%? It’s up by a number that nobody… And people are leaving. They’re looking at all of this and they can’t believe it. They can’t believe it. Whether it’s my supporter or not.
    ID: 271.0 Negative: And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president. Let me take this moment to say something we don’t say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President, you were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to. No one’s going to say that about the current occupant of the White House. What you know about this president is if he’s given four more years, he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years. The president takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division. He’ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him, never about you. Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America, one that’s generous and strong, selfless, and humble. It’s an America we could rebuild together.
    ID: 468.0 Positive: 6) We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you.
    ID: 590.0 Negative: You have somebody in Philadelphia who’s worse, right? Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that’s what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, “No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said.” If you don’t do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don’t think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No second amendment.
    ID: 1215.0 Positive: That happened quickly, Rudy. That didn’t take too long.
    ID: 264.0 Positive: As Americans, I’m confident we believe in honesty and decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, giving everyone a fair shot, leaving no one behind, giving hate no safe harbor, and demonizing no one. We, up to now, always recognize there’s something bigger than ourselves, that’s what we’re about. Trump doesn’t seem to believe in any of that. Look, I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it, America is an idea. It’s the most powerful idea in the history of the world. And I believe it beats in the hearts of the people of this country. All men and women are created equal and they deserve to be treated equally.
    ID: 349.0 Positive: I started today by speaking about the tragedy in El Paso one year ago. We also know Latinos suffer every day from hate crimes and gun violence. It doesn’t always make national headlines. Under the Biden administration, we’re going to get weapons of war and high capacity magazines out of our communities. I’m going to take the fight directly to the NRA and hold gun manufacturers accountable for the damage they caused to Latino families. Finally, we’re going to restore our values as a nation of immigrants.
    ID: 727.0 Positive: The police are under siege because of things … They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do. And one bad apple, or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke. Shooting the guy.
    ID: 1167.0 Negative: To protect our security, my administration instituted a travel ban on the world’s most dangerous regions. Biden has pledged to immediately end this travel ban and allow unlimited migration from terror zones, including Syria, Somalia, Libya, Iran, and Yemen. Trouble, trouble. I also kept the promise I made to Minnesota four years ago. I signed an executive order requiring state and local consent before any refugees are admitted. Biden would immediately shred that executive order, overriding local communities like yours, you know that. Did you know I signed that? You have to give approval now. Little different than the old days, isn’t it, huh? A little bit different. The old days was a lot different, and I signed that approval. They have to go through a process now, and you have to approve it. Why should we send everybody up to Minnesota or any place else?
    ID: 909.0 Positive: You see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we’ve done, what we’ve achieved, whether it’s ventilators, whether it’s supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it’s supposed to work that way, federalist, it’s supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn’t have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we’re right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we’re sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We’re stocked, we’re stocked and I always say and I’ll say it again, there’s never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get a ventilator.
    ID: 415.0 Positive: Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would’ve wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why? We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what I’m talking about? The Chicken Tax. It’s a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn’t want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you’re making … But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. I’ll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you don’t want to know about it.
    ID: 1082.0 Positive: But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up. I took the greatest economy and I closed it up and we saved millions of lives, as many lives. It shouldn’t have been one, but what you see today, you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20. It would have been a horrible … It would not have been sustainable, and now we’re bringing it back and we’ll bring it back so strongly. I took unprecedented action to save the U.S. economy and support Wisconsin families. Under our Paycheck Protection Program, we helped save over 1 million Wisconsin jobs. Earlier this month, I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100,000 per year.
    ID: 460.0 Negative: 0) He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time? “Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security.” Well, it’s now four years, we haven’t touched it. We’ve protected it, and that’s going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he’s elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington.
    ID: 161.0 Negative: Well, I began to prepare by going over what the president has said, multiple lies he’s told. What I’d love to have as a crawler at the bottom of the screen of fact checker when we speak. If we really want him to do something, I think that would make a great, great debate. If everything both of us said was instantly fact-checked by an agreed to group of people out there then we move forward. But probably wouldn’t get very far in the debate. Now I’m looking forward to debating the President and I’m going to lay out as clearly as I can, what I think we have to do to bring this country back and build it back better. And I’m looking forward to the debate.
    ID: 933.0 Positive: Indiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I’ll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here’s the thing. So if they don’t have any enthusiasm, so you’d say, “Are you going to vote?” “I’m not getting up to vote.” Okay. “I want to watch television instead of vote.” All right. But here’s a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here’s a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they’re harvesting. “Hey, have you gotten your ballot?” “Yeah, I have my ballot.” “You going to sign it?” “Well, if you want, I’ll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.” That’s the most honest way of doing it, and that’s unfair.
    ID: 872.0 Negative: Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies, right up until the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.
    ID: 968.0 Positive: So, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don’t let them take it away from you. Don’t let them take it away. North Carolina, we love you. That’s why I’m here. Thank you very much. Very special people. Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you.
    ID: 1023.0 Negative: Joe Biden has pledged to remove this ban, opening the flood gates to terror and terror hotspots, and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700%. That’s the manifesto of AOC and Bernie. Joe Biden and Kamala. She’s another beauty. Also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else’s. District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala put a drug dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison. Four months later, the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman, mowed her down with an SUV, fracturing her skull and ruining her life. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.
    ID: 73.0 Positive: I don’t accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can’t keep good paying union jobs here in America and create more of them. I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. We have the most qualified workers in the world. American manufacturing, is the old expression you heard your grandpop say or your grandmother, was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. Well, guess what? It’s going to be part of the engine of American prosperity now in 2021, and we’re going to make it happen with American grit, American determination, and American union workers.
    ID: 497.0 Negative: Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you’re campaigning, you can’t have more than five people. They-

If you want to rigorously evaluate my self-classified sample, it is all above to do so. However, I just want to highlight some specific classifications I made that should help to clarify my process.

For one, it depends on the amount of positive/negative in the document. Take a look at the following two examples:
1.   "If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won’t take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn’t even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don’t know that because the fake news doesn’t want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we’re going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that’s incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe."
2.   "In his joint manifesto with Bernie Sanders, Biden just called for a complete suspension of deportations, closing down detention facilities, ending border prosecutions. Think of this. Restoring and expanding catch and release, handing out free welfare to new arrivals, work permits for illegal crossers, and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens. Can you believe this? This is Bernie plus … I feel like Biden would be taken right. This is to show you how good a negotiate he is. Bernie took him left. It’s supposed to start and they’re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe, for them. For us it’s right of center. But Bernie actually took him left along with AOC plus three, right? AOC plus …"

I classified document 1 as a positive document. Even though there is a significant amount of negative attacks against Joe Biden, it only constitutes a third of the document. The rest is touting his own record in dealing with COVID-19. As a result, the bigger thesis of this document is that he has successfully handled the virus, which is a positive sentiment.

In comparison, document 2 is an overtly negative document. Here, Trump is describing how 'radical' Biden's agenda is, and the central thesis is that Biden is too far left for this country.

Let's look at another example:


*   "These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right?"

While this does seem to be negative in tone (as he is verbally attacking pollsters and saying they are doing there job wrong), it is not directed at "Democrats," "the radical left," or "Joe Biden." Thus, with my classification scheme, this counts as positive. Negative attacks have to be directed at the other side.

But as a general note, I am heavily prone to error, just as everyone else is. I am sure to have made some mistakes, and an ideal process would involved a larger group of diverse political ideologies classifying these. I tried to err on the side of positive. Just to acknowledge my bias, I am a supporter of Joe Biden, which could influence my determinations of what is positive and negative. I am certain that a Trump supporter might come to some different classifications.

Now, with our training data classified, we can build and train a model to hopefully classify the rest of the data.

# Building a Model

We are going to use what is called a Naive Bayes classifier to classify sentiment. If you are more interested in the mechanics behind this algorithm, there are plenty of places to study up on it online. I will just point out the fundamental idea of it:

The Naive Bayes algorithm is built on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that each of many predicting factors are independent from the others. In this case, each word and its presence in a document independently affect the probability of it being a positive or a negative document. As such, it can simply look at the words to determine whether it is positive or negative (after being trained with what words tend to be positive and what words tend to be negative).

Lucky for us, we do not need to actually implement the algorithm, as the nltk has that handled. Instead, we just need to feed it our training_data first.

We first just put the data into the right form, a list of all the documents with tuples containing their tokens and their tags.


```
training_data = []
biden_training = []
trump_training = []
biden_negative = 0
biden_positive = 0

trump_negative = 0
trump_positive = 0
for doc in df.iterrows():
  training_data.append((doc[1]['tokens'], doc[1]['tag']))
  if documents[doc[1]['doc_id']]['candidate'] == 'biden':
    biden_training.append((doc[1]['tokens'], doc[1]['tag']))
    if(doc[1]['tag'] == 'Negative'):
      biden_negative += 1
    else:
      biden_positive += 1
  else:
    trump_training.append((doc[1]['tokens'], doc[1]['tag']))
    if(doc[1]['tag'] == 'Negative'):
      trump_negative += 1
    else:
      trump_positive += 1
```

Now that the training data is assembled, we can look at some fundamental statistics of it.


```
print("trump docs: " + str(len(trump_training)) + " num positive: " + str(trump_positive) + " num negative: " + str(trump_negative))
print("biden docs: " + str(len(biden_training)) + " num positive: " + str(biden_positive) + " num negative: " + str(biden_negative))
```

    trump docs: 357 num positive: 227 num negative: 130
    biden docs: 143 num positive: 102 num negative: 41
    

As seen above, 130 out of 357 documents spoken by Trump were negative, representing about 36%. In comparison, 41 out of 143 documents spoken by Biden were negative, forming about 29%. This indicates that within the training documents, Trump was more negative than Biden, but the difference was not extreme.

To test the significance of this difference, we can do a z-test for the difference in two proportions. Our null hypothesis is going to be that the two proportions are equal. Our alternate hypothesis will be that the proportion of negative documents in each is not the same.



```
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest
stat, pval = proportions_ztest([130,41],[357,143])
print("Test statistic: " + str(stat) + " P-value: " + str(pval))
```

    Test statistic: 1.6493532689323889 P-value: 0.0990752824670348
    

We can see that our p-value for this test is approximately .1. Using a reasonable alpha value of .05, this does not indicate that there is a statistiscally significant difference. Thus, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportion of negative documents from Trump versus Biden. Interestingly, this would be statistically significant if we were to use a one-tailed test instead of a two-tailed test, but it is not appropriate to test with intent to show one side is more negative than the other.


We can then build the model with it. However, we do not want to use all 500 documents. We can use the first 333, which make up about 27% of all the documents, as the training data. We are then going to use the remaining 167 that I have classified to test the model and see its accuracy.


```

As we can see above, the Trump model is decidedly more accurate than the combined model, which is decently accurate. However, the Biden model is quite inaccurate.

We trained three models. The first model is trained with the combined training_data from both Trump and Biden. The second model is only trained for Biden, and the third model is only trained for Trump. Looking at the accuracies of them, we can see the Trump only model has the highest accuracy and the Biden only model has the lowest. This might indicate that Trump is more consistent with his negative attacks (and the predictors are thus more determinitive), but some of this might also be a result of there being significantly more Trump documents, resulting in more training data as well as more testing data. As a whole, I am not going to claim that these models are particularly accurate. The accuracy is just too low for each of them. But, they certainly can still be interesting and possibly insightful.

Additionally, we can look at the "most informative features" for each of them. On the Biden model, we see that some of Biden's most informative features for determining negativity are common words that aren't too insightful. For example, "would" or "almost." But we can see some patterns for the other words: "die" and "pandemic" are likely about Covid-19, as is "immediately" (Biden constantly describes the immediate actions he would take to combat it). This is his most common negative attack, describing how Trump has failed to respond to the pandemic. Additionally, his attacks then make himself seem like the compassionate candidate, such as how he can "feel" our "worry." This is a major pillar of his messaging, so it makes sense. 

Looking at Trump's most informative features is a lot more interesting because more of the words can be distinguished. His most common attack is how Biden wants "radical change" or that he is from the "radical left," which is seen here. He also mentions how Biden wants to "destroy" the suburbs," which could help explain the presence of "destroy." Of course, "gun" control also shows up here, a common and successful Republican messaging strategy that has gone on a long time.

However, we can instead examine some different specifics of these models. Precision and recall are common ways to measure pattern recognition. In this case, our precision will be the percent of documents predicted to be negative that were actually negative. Our recall will be the percent of actual negative documents that were classified as negative.

So let's take a look:


```
biden_predicted_neg = 0
biden_total_neg = 0
biden_predicted_neg_correct = 0
for doc in biden_training[biden_two_thirds:]:
  tag = biden_classifier.classify(doc[0])
  if tag == 'Negative':
    if doc[1] == 'Negative':
      biden_predicted_neg_correct += 1
    biden_predicted_neg += 1
  if doc[1] == 'Negative':
    biden_total_neg += 1
  

print("biden precision: " + str(biden_predicted_neg_correct/biden_predicted_neg))
print("biden recall: " + str(biden_predicted_neg_correct/biden_total_neg))

trump_predicted_neg = 0
trump_total_neg = 0
trump_predicted_neg_correct = 0
for doc in trump_training[trump_two_thirds:]:
  tag = trump_classifier.classify(doc[0])
  if tag == 'Negative':
    if doc[1] == 'Negative':
      trump_predicted_neg_correct += 1
    trump_predicted_neg += 1
  if doc[1] == 'Negative':
    trump_total_neg += 1
print("trump precision: " + str(trump_predicted_neg_correct/trump_predicted_neg))
print("trump recall: " + str(trump_predicted_neg_correct/trump_total_neg))
```

    biden precision: 0.3076923076923077
    biden recall: 1.0
    trump precision: 0.5238095238095238
    trump recall: 1.0
    

As seen above, the two models have the same recall: 1. This means every negative document is being predicted as negative, which is good. However, both are wildly overpredicting the number of negative documents, which we see in precision. For every negative document in the Biden test data, the model is predicting there to be 3 negative documents. For the Trump data, the model is predicting 2 documents per actual negative document. This difference explains the difference in accuracy between the two models. This is a severe limitation of our model and the resulting conclusions.

Now how are these useful? Well, we know that both models are over-predicting negatives. Ideally, we want to resolve this. In this case, it is better to optimize for precision (because we would rather accuse candidates of being more positive than they are than being more negative than they are). This is certainly an avenue for further refinement of this process and will likely get better results.

However, for the time being, this will have to do. At the very least, we know the ways in which they are wrong (overpredicting negatives) and the scale at which that is happening, so we can try and keep account of that.

Additionally, we can save the classifiers for later use so that we ensure our data is consistent.


```
import pickle
save_classifier = open('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/biden_model.pickle', "wb")
pickle.dump(biden_classifier, save_classifier)
save_classifier.close()

save_classifier = open('/content/drive/My Drive/political_sentiment_analysis/trump_model.pickle', "wb")
pickle.dump(trump_classifier, save_classifier)
save_classifier.close()
```

And now we can move onto using it on the data at-large.

# Using Model on Larger Dataset

We now want to use our two models on all 1248 documents that we have obtained.

To do this, we simply just have to go through all of them and use the model corresponding to the candidate.


```
biden_pos = []
biden_neg = []

trump_pos = []
trump_neg = []

for doc in documents:
  if documents[doc]['candidate'] == 'biden':
    tag = biden_classifier.classify({token : True for token in documents[doc]['lem_form']})
    if tag == 'Positive':
      biden_pos.append(documents[doc]['lem_form'])
    elif tag == 'Negative':
      biden_neg.append(documents[doc]['lem_form'])
  else:
    tag = trump_classifier.classify({token : True for token in documents[doc]['lem_form']})
    if tag == 'Positive':
      trump_pos.append(documents[doc]['lem_form'])
    elif tag == "Negative":
      trump_neg.append(documents[doc]['lem_form'])
print("Biden pos: " + str(len(biden_pos)) + " Neg: " + str(len(biden_neg)) + " Proportion Negative: " + str(len(biden_neg)) + "/" + str(len(biden_neg) + len(biden_pos)) + " = " + str(len(biden_neg) / (len(biden_neg) + len(biden_pos)) ))
print("Trump pos: " + str(len(trump_pos)) + " Neg: " + str(len(trump_neg)) + " Proportion Negative: " + str(len(trump_neg)) + "/" + str(len(trump_neg) + len(trump_pos)) + " = " + str(len(trump_neg) / (len(trump_neg) + len(trump_pos)) ))
                                  
```

    Biden pos: 115 Neg: 247 Proportion Negative: 247/362 = 0.6823204419889503
    Trump pos: 324 Neg: 562 Proportion Negative: 562/886 = 0.6343115124153499
    

Now we can see the results. Out of the 362 Biden documents, 68% of them were predicted to be negative. Out of the 886 Trump documents, 63% of them were predicted to be negative.

It is important to note here that this does not imply that 68% of Biden's documents are negative and 63% of Trump's documents are negative. It just says that this is what the model thinks. And as we saw previously, the model wildly overpredicts the number of negative documents.

Now, the process that follows is not going to be precisely accurate. This is not going in a peer-reviewed journal or anything of the sort. Instead, this is just to help us think about this data and make conclusions from it.

We know that the biden model has a precision of .31 and the trump model has a precision of .52. This means that, in the test data, 31% of the predicted biden negatives were actually negative and 52% of the predicted trump negatives were actually negative. Because this test data was randomly sampled from the entire population, this should be relatively close to the actual precision for the population. As a result, we can use these precisions.

Biden:
$$.68 * .31 = .21$$

Trump:
$$.63 * .52 = .33$$

This implies that the actual numbers are closer to 21% negative for Biden's docs and 33% negative for Trump's docs.

Once again, I must emphasize that these are not precise. They are just trying to get the numbers into a more appropriate ballpark. In our sample, 29% of Biden's documents were negative and 36% of Trump's. These are much closer numbers and seem within the realm of possibility.

It does seem that, when trying to account for an inprecise model, Biden's documents are proportionally less negative than Trump's, but there is insufficient evidence to decisively conclude this.

# Conclusions, Limitations, and Further Study

This marks the end of this little experiment. Before I want to summarize the things that we have found out through this process, I want to emphasize the limitations of this research and these conclusions because they are numerous:

*   For one, the data is only coming from campaign events that have transcripts hosted on rev.com. There are possibly campaign events that were not transcribed on this website, and those are not included in our data. Also, the validity of the transcripts is dependent on rev.com. Any errors there were unaccounted for in this study.
*   Additionally, not every word was properly normalized. As we saw before, some words, like "mesmerized," were not normalized. This could have had a slight impact on the results.
*   An important limitation is that there were significantly more Trump documents than Biden documents. This led to the Trump model being better trained and having more data to test on. This could impact our results significantly.
*   Perhaps most important of all, the Naive Bayes models were very imprecise. Particularly Biden's, which was much more inaccurate. Thus, our data is not conclusive and rather just suggestive.

Alas, we have acknowledged why everything that follows will be preceded by qualifiers, such as "might" or "almost." Here are some of the conclusions we can attempt to make:
*   Our test for a difference in proportions (among our sample) was inconclusive. We could not reject the null hypothesis that Trump and Biden's documents were equally negative. However, a looser alpha value (such as .1) would have rejected this hypothesis, so it is not out of the realm of possibility.
*   Biden's negative attacks tend to focus on the Covid-19 pandemic, and the failure to respond to it. They tend to be empathetic, with Biden focusing on appealing to the nation's worry and conscience.
*   Trump's negative attacks on Biden tend to focus on how far left his platform is, particularly in context of gun control, trying to paint himself as the moderate candidate.
*   Finally, it seems that Biden might be less negative than Trump across the whole dataset of documents, but this is still uncertain and subject to additional testing. This is somewhat unexpected for traditional politics: the non-incumbent is generally more negative, as they have to make a case for why the incumbent has failed and why voters should 'fire' them. The incumbent, on the other hand, tends to stand more on their accomplishments and record to convince voters why they have done a good job, spending less time attackign the opponent. However, to followers of the current political climate, it should be no surprise that this expectation did not follow through in this dataset.

While these conclusions are valuable, all of them could use significantly more analysis and certainty. As such, there are many avenues for further research in this realm:


*   Finetune this model to optimize for precision to be more accurate. This could make us more confident with the classifications of the model if we could get the number of false negatives down.
*   Repeat with a larger number of people classifying the training data in order to subject it to less bias and produce better results.
*   Use other methods of sentiment analysis. Naive Bayes is perhaps the simplest way to do it, but it also is limited (hint, "naive" is in the name). Examining many of the other models and testing them would likely produce a better and more conclusive outcome.
*   Use a lot more data with a larger sample to get more accurate results.
*   Try the process again with different documents (perhaps sentences, groups of sentences, or some other classification). This could have a significant impact on the results, particularly when so many of the current documents have both significant negative and positive pieces to them. Fragmenting them into smaller pieces might make the model more accurate and precise.

Additionally, there are other ways we can examine this data that are not simply extensions. We can do clustering analysis to examine what documents clump together and what the most "important" words are. We can analyze how things have changed over time. Was sentiment different at the start of August than at the start of September? One particularly interesting idea is examining how the campaigns sentiment might impact the sentiment of its followers, using Twitter or Reddit. There was much debate over the 2020 primary cycle as to how campaigns inspire rhetoric among their supporters, so it could be insightful to examine the validity of this. There are many different ways that we can explore this data, all of which are useful in further understanding these two political campaigns, both fighting in, what they describe as, the "most important election in our lifetimes." 

I hope to be able to pursue some of this research on my own, as this project has combined two of my greatest passions: computer science and politics.

I used many resources throughout this process, but the one that got me started (and I closely referred to) is a guide on sentiment analysis by DigitalOcean, linked [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-perform-sentiment-analysis-in-python-3-using-the-natural-language-toolkit-nltk). Additionally, check out Hugh (who consulted with me on this project) do a bit of his own analysis of the data [here](https://wenjunsun.github.io/2020/09/12/What-do-Trump-and-biden-talk-about.html)
